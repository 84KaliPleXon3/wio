<h3>Acknowledgments  </h3>





I would like to thank my supervisor, Greg, for his support, encouragement  

and advice without which I would never have written this thesis. I would also  

like to thank Marsha and Ray who took the time to listen to my problems and  

read over drafts. I also have to thank my family for putting up with my  

endless hours in front of the family computer. Thanks also go Chris for  

understanding and listening to my crazy and sometimes weird ideas and M  

whose fault it was that I came to know about IRC. Also, thanks to all the  

crazy people on #Aussies, those I interviewed, the people who were  

motivated enough to fill in my surveys and the many and varied nicks who  

appear in my logs.  <p>

<h3>Abstract  </h3>

  

New technologies have the potential to reshape human communication. With  

the emergence of Computer Mediated Communication (CMC), this thesis  

seeks to explore the ways this medium alters the way people communicate on  

Internet Relay Chat (IRC), and yet also how it is that relationship formation in  

this medium on an interpersonal level reproduces aspects of Face to Face  

(FTF) communication by users adapting the medium to their needs. The users  

of IRC in this adaptation develop and maintain the many types of  

relationships that are present in FTF communication from enemies to friends  

to lovers. <p>

  

This thesis explores the nature of relationship formation on IRC using three  

theories. These theories show that relationships formed on IRC bare many  

similarities to FTF relationships, however, because new technology reshapes  

human relationships and because of the specific medium of CMC and its  

absence of physical presence, communication on IRC is developed in a  

specific nature as users adapt to the weaknesses and strengths of the medium.  

As a result, this thesis shows that IRC users develop a communicative  

richness, novel ways of expressing information and emotional meaning in  

relationship formation.   <p>

  

This thesis also explores the nature of the presentation and perception of self  

in CMC in contrast to the relatively simple notions of self expressed in the  

relationship formation theories. It is suggested that the peculiar nature of  

CMC and its absence of physical presence, highlights the extent to which the  

self presented in relationships is changeable depending on issues such as  

context. Using Goffman (1969) this thesis explores the various dimensions of  

the self on IRC.  

  

It is also noted that IRC, like all communications technologies, is inserted and  

developed in the context of existing social relations. It explores the way in  

which traditional forms of power are negotiated on IRC focusing particularly  

on the question of gender but also the way in which new forms of power  

relations are developed through the new medium.  <p>
