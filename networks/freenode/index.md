# freenode
freenode is a topical network focused on helping free and open source software
communities collaborate effectively. It has grown to become one of the single
largest IRC networks, and is unique in its policies and philosophy, which help to
support the network's core focus.

## History

Originally founded by the late Rob Levin (lilo) as the #linuxneo channel on EFNet,
changed name to #linpeople Moved around from EFNet to Undernet, to DalNet before
forming its own small network. Linpeople, which evolved into Openprojects.net and
later into freenode.

The nonprofit Peer-Directed Projects Center was created to oversee the freenode
project, and existed from 2002 to 2013, after which the freenode project continued,
but the nonprofit parent organization did not.

Over time, the strong focus on enabling free and open source project communities
transformed Freenode into the largest IRC network,

## Philosophy
freenode operates as a tightly managed, meritocratic project, under similar
principles of governance to many of the free and open source comminities which
call the network home.

### Catalysts
[Catalysts](https://freenode.net/catalysts) are central for the freenode culture
and philosophy - the freenode way is to resolve problems diplomatically, deescalate
situations early, and use authority and privilege as a last resort.

Trolls and other disruptive users certainly exist on freenode, as in any other
online community, but catalysts act as mediators and ambassadors of the network's
core values, and help to keep disruptions to a bare minimum without need of any
special authority or privilege.

### Linking
In accordance with this philosophy and network policies, and in a significant break
with the management practices of most other networks, servers are not "linked"
in the traditional administrative sense, rather, they are "hosted" with donated
servers, and the hosting organization receives no special consideration
beyond an acknowledgement of their donation, and no special privileges whosoever.

## Connecting to Freenode

freenode accepts connections at chat.freenode.net on port 6667 for non-SSL, and
on port 6697 for SSL. irc.freenode.net is an alias, and will work as well.

individual servers may change frequently, and specifying a specific server is not
recommended.

## Important Channels

The #freenode channel is the main network channel, and is where network staff can
be found.
We maintain the #irchelp channel on freenode as a general IRC help channel for
issues that do not require the attention of network staff, such as general usage
questions, IRC client configuration, and even IRC protocol questions.
