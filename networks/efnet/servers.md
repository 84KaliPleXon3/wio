EFNet does not have an official "round robin" DNS record, as EFNet has no central
governing body that could create one. Further, each server on the network sets it's
own policies for access and for acceptable user conduct, so it's likely that not all
servers will permit access, or even be reachable.

The following is a list of all client servers seen connected as of 12 July 2016

* irc.mzima.net
* irc.servercentral.net
* irc.umich.edu
* irc.colosolutions.net
* irc.Prison.NET
* irc.underworld.no
* efnet.port80.se
* irc.efnet.fr
* irc.nordunet.se
* irc.inet.tele.dk
* irc.homelien.no
* irc.du.se
* efnet.portlane.se
* irc.choopa.net
* <http://chat.efnet.org> (webchat server)

Another, semi-official server list can be found at <http://www.efnet.org/?module=servers>, which may be more or less current than this listing.
