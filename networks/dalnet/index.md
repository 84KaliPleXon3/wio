# DALnet

[DALnet](http://www.dal.net) started in 1994, and was the first of the major networks to implement both nickname and channel registration, in the now familiar form of nickserv and chanserv, making it immensely popular at the time for users without the resources to maintain their identities and channels on the more established EFNet and IRCNet networks, which, to this day, still offer no registration.
