# Konversation
[Konversation](https://konversation.kde.org/) is a graphical IRC client designed for use with the KDE desktop. Konversation is aimed at a general audience, with a feature set suited for the beginning to intermediate IRC user.

Though Konversation is a solid IRC client for general use, the scripting support feels comparatively immature and neglected, meaning that users with very complex needs, such as IRC Operators, may find it lacking.

## Key Features
* Tight integration with KDE desktop
* Can use KDE's On-Screen Display (OSD) features for notifications.
* Multiple server support, with seperate identities per server.
* SSL support

## Scripting
Scripting support within Konversation is comparatively basic, with automation handled by external programs through qdbus rather than having an embedded script interpreter. The [documentation](https://docs.kde.org/trunk5/en/extragear-network/konversation/scripting.html of this interface is rudimentary at best.
