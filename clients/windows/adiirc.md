## About AdiIRC <a name="About+AdiIRC"></a>

AdiIRC was first publicly released on January 07, 2016, and is presently in
active development.  It is a closed-source freeware IRC client for Windows,
modeled after the popular [mIRC](mirc) client, and written in C# (C-Sharp).
Compatible with Windows XP and later, and runs fine in Wine for Linux and
MacOS.  ~~AdiIRC is supported by donations.~~  The author, Per Amundsen, no
longer accepts monetary gain, but you could hire him at your Fortune 500
company! &Hat;&lowbar;&Hat;

> Q: What does "Adi" stands for? <br />
> A: Nothing really. It's an old prefix used for some other projects many years
  ago, and the prefix just carried over to this IRC client. Original it was
  derived from the song A.D.I.D.A.S by the band KoRn. According to some it could
  stand for "All Day I IRC" :P - Kr0n

## Scripting <a name="Scripting"></a>

AdiIRC supports a variant of the mIRC Scripting Language (mSL), with its own
additions and deviations from the official mIRC supported script.  Some features
and syntactic behaviours may not work as expected, but the developer is fairly
responsive to bug reports and suggestions for improvement.

The developer hosts his own [paste bin](https://kr0n.dk/) for use in the
[#AdiIRC](irc://chat.freenode.net/#adiirc) support channel.
