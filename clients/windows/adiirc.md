## About AdiIRC

AdiIRC was first publicly released on January 07, 2016, and is presently in
active development.  It is a closed-source freeware IRC client for Windows,
modeled after the popular [mIRC](mirc) client, and written in C# (C-Sharp).
Compatible with Windows Vista and later, and runs fine in Wine for Linux.
AdiIRC is supported by [donations](). <!--AdiIRC goes pretty good with Wine.-->

> Q: What does "Adi" stands for? <br />
>A: Nothing really. It's an old prefix used for some other projects many years ago, and the prefix just carried over to this IRC client. Original it was derived from the song A.D.I.D.A.S by the band KoRn. According to some it could stand for "All Day I IRC" :P - Kr0n


## Scripting

AdiIRC supports a variant of the mIRC Scripting Language (mSL), with its own
additions and deviations from the official mIRC supported script.  Some features
and syntactic behaviours may not work as expected, but the developer is fairly
responsive to community suggestions and bug reports.

The developer hosts his own [paste bin](https://kr0n.dk/) for use in the
[#AdiIRC](irc://chat.freenode.net/#adiirc) support channel.
