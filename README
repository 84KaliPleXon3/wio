This is the new and improved www.irchelp.org.

Directory Structure
-------------------

 * documents/ - contains the files that will be processed as input by PieCrust
 * otherfiles/ - contains other files, arranged into the same directory structure as the rest of the site.

Build Process
-------------

The build process should go something like this.

 1. a _target folder is created.
 2. the documents folder is processed with PieCrust and the output placed in
    the root of _target
 3. the otherfiles folder is copied to the root of _target, skipping any
    files that already exist from the build process
 4. Sanity checks are optionally performed (has the size dropped more than it should,
    etc)
 5. Entire contents of target are rsynced to a staging folder on the server.
 6. The live folder is renamed to old, and the staging folder is renamed so
    that it becomes the live folder.
