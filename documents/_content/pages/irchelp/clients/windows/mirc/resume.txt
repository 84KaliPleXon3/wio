mIRC 5.4 DCC resume exploit

updated 7/16/98

By exploiting a bug in the latest version of mIRC (5.4), another user
can maliciously crash your mIRC using a broken DCC resume command.

To get around this, you may downgrade back to version 5.31, or else put
the following line in your remotes until the problem is fixed with a new
version, which should be coming soon hopefully.

	ctcp 1:DCC RESUME:halt

(Note this is a stricter rule than the one we originally suggested on
7/15, and will block all DCC resumes, even legitimate ones. This is
necessary since lamers are finding ways to get around the more specific
rules.)

To access the remote section press alt-r ... you can copy (ctrl-c) and
paste (ctrl-p) anywhere in the remotes. Finally, make sure you have
activated your remotes by typing on a separate line in mIRC:

	/remotes on

This will stop any variant of the dcc resume bug exploit.

This is not known to be a problem with 5.31 or any earlier version.
