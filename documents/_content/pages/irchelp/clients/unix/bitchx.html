## Overview

Once widely popular, [BitchX](http://www.bitchx.com/) incorporates many features traditionally found in script packages directly into an IRC client. BitchX has a reputation for being the kitchen sink of terminal-based IRC clients.


## Caution 

Because of the all-inclusive approach, and default settings which may not be suitable for all users, it's essential to read the documentation carefully and adjust some settings (beyond the "I'm to lame to read BitchX.doc" message) before using BitchX, and particularly before using it while opped in a channel. The defaults for the channel protection features may be too agressive for your channel and lead to unwanted kicks and bans.


## Features
 * Built-in detach/reattach similar to the "screen" utility.
 - Built-in channel protection.
 - eggdrop-like functionality built-in to the client.
