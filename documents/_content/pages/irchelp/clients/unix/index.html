#Unix/Linux IRC Clients

## Terminal

The first clients and servers for IRC were written as portable C code, which could be compiled and run on a variety of Unix derivatives, including many of the systems common in academic research at the time. The original IRC client, which was once distributed in the same package with IRCNet's IRCD, is now obsolete, but many other clients have improved upon it's design.

### irssi
[irssi](/irchelp/clients/unix/irssi.html) has taken ircII's place as the modern gold standard for IRC clients, with a sensible, familiar interfaces, sane defaults, modern featureset, and of course, an embedded perl interpeter as its scripting interface.

### ircII and derivatives
For years, the standard by which all other clients were measured, [ircII](irchelp/clients/unix/ircii/) and its derivatives remain a solid choice. ircII, and it's closest descendant, [EPIC[(/irchelp/clients/unix/epic.html) are still actively maintained, but maintain faithfulness with the original "blank canvas" of ircII - they are typically highly customized by each user, with by hand, or via a script pack.

[BitchX](/irchelp/clients/unix/bitchx.html) and [ScrollZ](/irchelp/clients/unix/scrollz.html) take a different approach, both having their original start as script packs, they eventually applied their modifications directly to the client itself, creating a derivative of ircII with more bells and whistles than any user could possibly need.

### WeeChat
[WeeChat](/irchelp/clients/unix/weechat.html) is a relative newcomer to the terminal oriented client scene, but still compares favorably to the others. It's comparable in features to irssi, but, uniquely, also functions as a Jabber client.

### ERC (emacs IRC client)

Everyone's favorite kitchen sink has a built in IRC client, [ERC](/irchelp/clients/unix/erc.html), which is fully functional, extensible in the Lisp language so fondly loved by emacs users, and sadly, relevant to almost no-one else. If your text editor is also your operating system, it might be a great first choice for you, otherwise, consider sticking with the more mainstream clients.
