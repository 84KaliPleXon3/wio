# irssi

[irssi](http://www.irssi.org) is a mature, full-featured terminal-based IRC client for Unix/Linux systems. 

## Key Features

 * Extensible with scripts written in [Perl](www.perl.org)
 * Fully configurable keybindings, formats, and themes.
 * irssi-proxy (client can be used as a bouncer for another client)

## First-time Configuration

irssi works well out of the box for most users, and the defaults are generally unobtrusive to other users. Power users may find the number of window selection keybindings inadequate, but beyond that, little or no configuration is  needed.
