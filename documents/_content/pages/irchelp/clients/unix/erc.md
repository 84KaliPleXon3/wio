title: ERC (Emacs IRC Client)
---

The text editor and kitchen sink GNU emacs has a obscure, but built-in IRC client in the form of [ERC](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/erc.html).

ERC is included by default in v22.3 and above of GNU emacs, but some distributions may place it in a seperate package.

More information can be found on the [emacs wiki](http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki/ERC)
