# Specialized Clients - Bots, Bouncers, and everything else

This category covers special types of clients, such as bots, bouncers, and other programs that connect into IRC, but don't provide the typical client interface.

## Bots

### Eggdrop

[Eggdrop](http://www.eggheads.org/) is a widely popular IRC bot package, and is frequently used either to protect channels in the absence of services, or to provide services to a channel beyond what the network's services can provide.

Still the most popular bot for channel protection purposes, Eggdrop provides a framework for managing user accounts, networking between bots, and a DCC partyline for management, as well as a TCL interpreter for extending the bot.

Other Eggdrop Resources:

* [egghelp.org](http://www.egghelp.org)
* [eggwiki.org](http://eggwiki.org)

Support Channels:

* #egghelp on EFNet


### Infobot
[Infobot](http://www.infobot.org/) is a popular "FAQ" bot for IRC channels, with a rudamentary capability to be taught boilerplate answers to common questions.

### Irker

[Irker](http://www.catb.org/esr/irker) is a version control notification bot written by Eric S. Raymond to replace the defunct CIA notification service.
It is used to notify a channel of software developers when changes are "committed" or "pushed" to various version control systems, including Git.

IRC channels:

* [#irker on Freenode](irc://chat.freenode.net/#irker)


### Other Bots
This is by no means a comprehensive list of bot software, expecially given that full-featured IRC clients often have functionality that borders on bot-like, and many specialized bots exist to particular tasks. Software developers in particular are fond of writing bots for specific tasks, like announcing commits to version control systems, outcomes of software builds and testing, and other things that interest them.

## Bouncers

Bouncers, also known as IRC proxies, proxy IRC connections for reasons of privacy, security, or vanity, and they may additionally function as bots as well, allowing persistant presence for users with intermittant connections.

### bnc

### znc

### psybnc

### Clients with built in proxies

Several unix clients also function as IRC proxies, and are documented on their
respective pages: 

* [irssi](/irchelp/clients/unix/irssi/)
* [weechat](/irchelp/clients/unix/weechat.html)
* [quassel](/irchelp/clients/unix/quassel.html)


## Others

Some "specialty" clients may not fit cleanly into any of these categories. They are listed here.
