# Specialized Clients - Bots, Bouncers, and everything else

This category covers special types of clients, such as bots, bouncers, and other programs that connect into IRC, but don't provide the typical client interface.

## Bots

### Eggdrop

[Eggdrop](http://www.eggheads.org/) is a widely popular IRC bot package, and is frequently used either to protect channels in the absence of services, or to provide services to a channel beyond what the network's services can provide.

### Infobot
[Infobot](http://www.infobot.org/) is a popular "FAQ" bot for IRC channels, with a rudamentary capability to be taught boilerplate answers to common questions.

### Other Bots
This is by no means a comprehensive list of bot software, expecially given that full-featured IRC clients often have functionality that borders on bot-like, and many specialized bots exist to particular tasks. Software developers in particular are fond of writing bots for specific tasks, like announcing commits to version control systems, outcomes of software builds and testing, and other things that interest them.

## Bouncers

Bouncers, also known as IRC proxies, proxy IRC connections for reasons of privacy, security, or vanity, and they may additionally function as bots as well, allowing persistant presence for users with intermittant connections.

## Others

Some "specialty" clients may not fit cleanly into any of these categories. They are listed here.
