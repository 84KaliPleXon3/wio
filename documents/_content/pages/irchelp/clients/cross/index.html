=Cross-platform IRC clients

==ChatZilla==
[ChatZilla](/irchelp/clients/cross/chatzilla.html) runs as an addon for
Firefox and Seamonkey, or standalone with the help of XULRunner, and as such
is portable to all platforms on which Firefox can run. 

==LeafChat==
[LeafChat](/irchelp/clients/cross/leafchat.html) is a graphical, standalone
client written in Java, and runs anywhere there's a suitable Java runtime.

## jIRCii

[jIRCii](/irchelp/clients/cross/jircii.html) is a barely graphical standalone Java
client, with a look and feel inspired by [ircII](/irchelp/clients/unix/ircii/) but taking advantage of
modern GUI functionality.


==Web Based Clients==
Webchat interfaces are listed [elsewhere](/irchelp/clients/webclients.html),
and are available anywhere there's a working web browser.

==Linux/Unix Clients on Windows==
Many of the terminal-based Unix/Linux IRC clients have been ported to run on
Windows with the aid of Cygwin or MSYS. These ported clients may be awkward to use
if not comfortable with console-mode applications, and primarily cater to
advanced users.

The popular X11 client, xchat, also has a Windows version, which is a common
alternative to mIRC on Windows systems.


==Windows Clients on Linux/Unix/OSX==

mIRC is known to [work well with Wine](http://appdb.winehq.org/objectManager.php?sClass=application&iId=77).
