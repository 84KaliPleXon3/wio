# ChatZilla

[ChatZilla](http://chatzilla.hacksrus.com) is a cross-platform IRC client, usable as [a standalone program](http://chatzilla.rdmsoft.com/xulrunner/), available as a built-in component of [SeaMonkey](http://www.seamonkey-project.org/), and as [an extension for Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/chatzilla/).

ChatZilla is a possible contender for the widest availability of a graphical IRC client, being usable on any platform on which Firefox is available. 

## Key Features

 * Graphical client
 * Written in, and extensible with JavaScript

## Getting ChatZilla

### As part of SeaMonkey

ChatZilla is included in builds of the SeaMonkey application suite. SeaMonkey can be readily downloaded for Windows, Linux, and MacOSX, and ports exist for a number of other platforms.

### As an extension for Firefox

* [Download and install](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/chatzilla/) the extension from within Firefox.
* Restart Firefox when prompted.
* Access ChatZilla from the Tools menu. 

### As a standalone application

As of this writing, it's still possible to run a standalone version of ChatZilla, but challenging due to a dependency on XULRunner, which has reached end of life.
