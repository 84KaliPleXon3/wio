# ChatZilla

[ChatZilla](http://chatzilla.hacksrus.com) is a cross-platform IRC client, usable as [a standalone program](http://chatzilla.rdmsoft.com/xulrunner/), available as a built-in component of [SeaMonkey](http://www.seamonkey-project.org/), and as [an extension for Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/chatzilla/).

ChatZilla is a full-featured IRC client, best suited to users who are intimately familiar with the workings of IRC, very consistant across a wide range of platforms and execution enviroments. Being built on the same core as Mozilla's popular Firefox browser, ChatZilla is largely written and extensible with modern web technologies, namely JavaScript and CSS, which leans to extensive themeability.

ChatZilla has a very dedicated core following of Mozilla developers and community members. ChatZilla has features that cater to an audience of developers, including detecting and linkifying references to bug reports, and naturally, those features come preconfigured to work with Mozilla's development toolchain.

## Key Features

 * Graphical client
 * Full scripting interface via JavaScript
 * Tab completion
 * Themeable via CSS


## Getting ChatZilla

### As part of SeaMonkey

ChatZilla is included in builds of the SeaMonkey application suite. SeaMonkey can be readily downloaded for Windows, Linux, and MacOSX, and ports exist for a number of other platforms.

### As an extension for Firefox

* [Download and install](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/chatzilla/) the extension from within Firefox.
* Restart Firefox when prompted.
* Access ChatZilla from the Tools menu. 

### As a standalone application

As of this writing, it's still possible to run a standalone version of ChatZilla, but challenging due to a dependency on XULRunner, which has reached end of life.
