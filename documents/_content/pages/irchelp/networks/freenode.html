#Freenode#

Originally founded as Openproject, Freenode is now the largest IRC network,
with a strong focus on free and open source software and related projects.

Freenode is known for a unique network philosophy, which is centrally
managed in accordance with the charitable purpose of it's parent
organization, the Peer Directed Project Center. The organization states
quite simply on it's website:

	The purpose for which the corporation is organised is to help
	peer-directed project communities flourish. Peer-directed projects
	combine open, informal participation with broad licensing and wide
	dissemination of output.
