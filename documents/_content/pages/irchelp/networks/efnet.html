#EFNet#

Once the largest IRC network, it share the claim with IRCNet of being the
oldest IRC network.

EFNet and IRCNet both share a unique, decentralized philosophy, and continue
to shun nickname and channel registration, and enforce a distinct seperation
between network and channel matters. 

As there are [no registration services](/irchelp/networks/noserv.html),"ownership" of nicknames and channels
are not guranteed.

Channels fare a little better than nicknames, but not much, with a service called chanfix
designed to promote channel stability without officially recognizing
ownership.
