# Adding yourself to our networks list

Since the IRChelp.org network list has a high profile, many people ask us how
to get their new network added here. Please read through this carefully. If
you rush and skip around, you'll just be wasting your time and ours, and we
will ignore your request.

There are over 600 IRC networks out there, and as of early 2004, over 120 of
them average over 1000 users already. That's a lot of choices! _Are you quite
sure you're contributing something new and unique?_ If you just want to play
and learn about [ircd](../ircd/), by all means knock yourself out, but you
should have realistic expectations of [running your own server](../ircd
/server-request.html).

If you're still interested in being listed here, [email the
webmaster](../mail.cgi) directly with all of the following information. _Be
sure to select the webmaster from the list of helpers in the form, and answer
ALL questions, or else your message will be discarded._ Let me be honest - the
vast majority of submissions will be rejected. There is just no point in
having a comprehensive list of hundreds of nets, no user has the patience to
read through all that, plus there are already comprehensive, opt-in network
lists such as [netsplit.de](http://irc.netsplit.de/networks/) and
[SearchIRC](http://www.searchirc.com) (ext. links).

We will _not_ acknowledge or respond to your message unless we need extra
information. Do not email more than once, or to check on the status.
_Consideration may take many months or even years_, which shouldn't matter to
you if you're a stable, long-term network. Our decisions are final.

  1. **What are your /luser statistics?** Paste output from `/lusers` using a standard client such as mIRC or ircII so that it shows the number of users and servers. You should have at least a few hundred average users, which would put you in the top half of all networks out there. Any less than that, we wish you luck, but there are thousands of individual _channels_ already that are bigger than your whole network. 
  2. **What is your unique contribution?** _This is VERY important!_ Give a single sentence description of your network. Avoid vague stuff like "a fun, safe place to chat." Instead, tell us what you provide that nobody else does. Do you support a specific country or language that doesn't have an IRC network already? Do you serve people with a special interest or hobby? In other words, why should I chat on your network instead of the hundres of others? 
  3. **What are your web site addresses?** List and explain all useful URLs for your network: home page, server/channel list, history, policies, Java chat access, etc. The first few items are particularly important, if you don't have them yet, create them. 
  4. **What is the default port or ports?** e.g., 6667, 6660-6669, 7000, etc. 
  5. **What country or countries are your servers located in?**
  6. **What services do you run?** For example: nickname, channel, memo, etc. What is the nickname of each service/bot? Is there some URL explaining their use? 
  7. **When was your network founded?** Give month and year. We value longevity as an indication of your stability. 
  8. **What are your help channels?** List all help channels where people can go to get help or information on general IRC questions, servers, policies, etc. If there are open oper/admin channels, name those too. 
  9. **Do you have restrictive policies?** I'm talking about bots, file trading, pornography, etc. There is no right or wrong answer, we support free speech, but the users need to know this. 

Hope that seems reasonable. We're not trying to make this more difficult than
it needs to be. We need all of that information in order to evaluate your
network and provide information that lusers want and deserve.
