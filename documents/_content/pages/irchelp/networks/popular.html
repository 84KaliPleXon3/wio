# Popular IRC Networks

_Selected Networks with 10,000+ Users_

* * *

updated Nov 7, 2003

This page is part of the [IRChelp.org Networks
Site](http://www.irchelp.org/irchelp/networks/), please do not mirror or
distribute.

We highlight here some popular networks with average user counts of 10,000 to
170,000 and up. These nets tend to have the largest, busiest channels. For
example, some channels have over 2000 people, so just one channel like that
has more people than 97% of the 800+ networks out there!

Size isn't everything, though. These nets have lots of fun chat but also an
abundance of the "dark side" of IRC: [illegal file
trading](../security/warez.html), lag, splits, ad spams, pornography,
[trojan/virus infections](../security/trojan.html), [denial of service
attacks](../nuke/), etc. It's no wonder then that many experienced IRC users
prefer other alternatives, such as smaller nets that still have lots of people
but far fewer problems, or nets devoted to specific subjects or geographical
areas / languages.

The popular nets are listed alphabetically with no regard to size. All links
take you away to pages hosted by that network or to the 3rd party statistics
site [netsplit.de](http://irc.netsplit.de/networks/), which hosts
comprehensive, opt-in network lists such as the [top
charts](http://irc.netsplit.de/networks/list1uma.var). Another similar site is
[SearchIRC](http://www.searchirc.com). Our purpose is just to get you going by
providing important links and information for some selected nets, so that you
can quickly compare them or get their home page, server list, etc. Some
information is quoted directly "like this" from the net's own site.

The following networks are highlighted below: Aniverse, BRASnet, EFNet, Enter
The Game, Freenode, Galaxynet, GamesNET, IRCNet, PTNet, QuakeNet, Undernet.

[EFnet.info](http://efnet.info/?module=servers)

**Information**: Formerly the prime IRC network and for a long time synonymous with IRC. EFnet stands for Eris-Free net, due to a historical event involving a server with a machine name of 'eris'. In 1996, many servers and users split off to form what is now IRCnet, since then both networks have grown and prospered independently. Both still do not support services such as channel or nickname registration, resulting in the most freedom as well as chaos for the users.

Many of the most popular channels are "national" channels, devoted to the social gathering of people from Europe and Japan.
