#EFNet#

Once the largest IRC network, it share the claim with IRCNet of being the
oldest IRC network.

EFNet and IRCNet both share a unique, decentralized philosophy, and continue
to shun nickname and channel registration, and enforce a distinct seperation
between network and channel matters. 

As there are [no registration services](/irchelp/networks/noserv.html),"ownership" of nicknames and channels
are not guranteed.

Channels fare a little better than nicknames, but not much, with a service called chanfix
designed to promote channel stability without officially recognizing
ownership.

## Governance

EFNet is a loose confederation of servers, with each server having it's own
policies and IRC operators. 

New servers are voted on by regional routing bodies in each of 3 recognized
geographical regions, US (US-EFNet), Canada (CA-EFNet), and Europe
(EU-EFNet). Servers outside of one of the regions are considered part of
the same region as their closest hub, according to network topography.

A handful of global policies have been adopted by a majority vote of all
server admins, including the adoption of chanfix, and the adoption of
glines.
