# This document has been removed.

We formerly had manual fixes for a number of common trojans collected on
this site. These documents have been removed because they are badly outdated
and considered obsolete.

Manual removal of a virus or trojan is difficult, time consuming, and
requires positive identification of the exact infection, otherwise you may
either leave infected files behind, or damage important system files.

Malware removal programs are now available to accurately detect and remove
infected files, making such instructions largely unnecessary. 

Please see [our section on trojan horses](/irchelp/security/trojan.html] for
current information.
