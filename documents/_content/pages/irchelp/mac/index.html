**Colloquy 2.x** &nbsp_place_holder; [ [ home page](http://colloquy.info/) | [screen cap](http://colloquy.info/screenshots.html) ] 

Open source freeware that uses an interface similar to Apple's iChat. If you
are a relative novice and just looking for something easy and simple (not to
mention free), this will do just fine. This client is "light weight" in the
sense that it contains only the basic IRC features and none of the many frills
you'll find in full GUI clients like Snak and Ircle. This is in part due to
the relatively new history (really only active since 2004 or so), and in part
also intentionally to keep things simple and easy for newbies. They'll gladly
take donations, but otherwise just use it for free. :) [Thanks to JustDave at
Mozilla.org for the tip.]

**Snak 5.2.x** &nbsp_place_holder; [ [ home page](http://www.snak.com/Snak.html) | [screen cap](snak.gif) ]

This client is what I personally recommend to users who may be coming from a
Windows/mIRC background (welcome!) or who want a more serious IRC client with
all the latest bells and whistles, full support, etc. Snak is the most rich in
features and has been actively developed since the 1990s, with dozens of
updates over the past few years while the traditional gold standard Ircle has
essentially stood still. Snak appeals to people who prefer a streamlined
interface without sacrificing all the "cool" features. Everything for each
channel is contained in one window, docking windows will in fact allow
multiple channels to share a window to maximize your precious screen space.
The channel list feature is particularly fast and easy to use (unlike Ircle).
Very easy to set up and configure. Supports both the scripting language from
the classic [ircII](/irchelp/ircii/) client for *nix (UNIX, Linux, etc.) shell
access acounts, so you can tap into the wealth of existing ircII scripts, as
well as Ircle-style Applescript scripts. There are also automated responses to
events so that you can set up script-like actions without being a scripting
expert. For those who like such things, fully customizable appearance themes
are available. Supports multiple connections, and for each connection, uses
ircII-style server lists which will automatically try the next server in a
list until it succeeds (Ircle only allows one server to be defined for each
connection). Guardian feature permits adult control, for what that's worth
(Ircle has none). MP3 list feature facilitates downloads. Excellent built-in
help menu, balloon help, and bundled help manual (Ircle has none). $29
shareware (covering updates over 2 years) is a great value and an example of
how [shareware](../misc/shareware.html) really can work.

**X-Chat Aqua 0.x** &nbsp_place_holder; [ [ home page](http://xchataqua.sourceforge.net/) | [screen cap](http://xchataqua.sourceforge.net/twiki/bin/view/Main/XChatAquaShots) ] 

Open source freeware based on the old-school Unix/X11 GUI client XChat, but
with the GUI redone to run natively in Mac OS X. If all those acronyms sound
like geekspeak, then you should skip this client for now. This is not for
newbies, but rather more appropriate if you are already a savvy ircII user
looking to upgrade from text-only to a GUI, while still being too much of a
"Mac Purist" to run XChat under X11. Don't worry about the 0.x version number,
we don't recommend bleeding-edge crashware. They just count slowly; this
client has been around since 2002 at least. Price: $0. [Thanks to JustDave at

**Ircle 3.1.x production / 3.5ax alpha test version** &nbsp_place_holder; [ [home page](http://www.ircle.com/) | [screen cap](ircle.gif) | [setup guide](ircle_setup.html) ]

Way back in the beginning (1990s), Ircle was the gold standard against which
all other Mac IRC clients were compared. Ircle is still popular, perhaps
simply because for many years it was the only option that was full-featured,
stable, fairly easy to use, and stuck around when other clients came and went.
Ircle pioneered many ideas: scripting via AppleScript, simultaneous
connections to multiple networks, file servers to exchange files, and channel
protection features. Active development ended in 1999, but over the years
Ircle continues to crank out incremental updates mostly to maintain
compatibility with OS X, hence the different version numbers in the heading.
Ircle's support is fairly minimal: simple setup guides, barebones built-in
help, and a web based forum. Thankfully, because it's been around so long,
there are many 3rd party support sites, free scripts, help channels, etc. 19 â‚¬
shareware (about US$25, or [click for instant calculation](http://finance.yaho
o.com/currency/convert?amt=19&from=EUR&to=USD&submit=Convert) [ext. link]). In
terms of setup, you can jump right in by selecting one of the pre-configured
network/channel combinations from the included "Chat channels" folder.
Alternatively, set things up properly using the _Connections_ window. If you
need help, check out our illustrated, step by step [setup
guide](http://www.irchelp.org/irchelp/mac/ircle_setup.html) or the Ircle home
page's [reference pages](http://www.ircle.com/reference/).

** [IrcII *nix shell clients](../ircii/)**

It's a sign of the times, but now that Mac OS X has become mainstream, Apple
is the world's #1 distributor of *nix (UNIX/Linux/BSD etc.) computers! If you
are reasonably savvy with IRC, you should probably consider the text-only
shell clients like ircII. This tends to be the choice of the most experienced
IRC users.

**Other Reviews**: 

We really try to focus our recommendations on clients that have withstood the
test of time. I drive some people crazy when I say this, but take it from
somebody who has been on IRC since 1993: If you just want a reliable program
for chatting, there is really no reason to look beyond Ircle or Snak. If you
like playing with new clients that might have interesting new features (and
perhaps serious bugs), feel free to check out the many other choices described
at these exhaustive sites.
