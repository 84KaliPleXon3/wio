<h2>Conclusion</h2>

  

This thesis has sought to explore the nature of relationship formation on IRC  

by recourse to three theories. These theories showed that relationships formed  

on IRC bore many similarities to FTF relationships, however, because new  

technology reshapes human relationships and because of the specific medium  

of CMC and its absence of physical presence, it was shown that  

communication on IRC is developed in a specific nature as users adapt to the  

weaknesses and strengths of the medium. As a result, this thesis showed that  

IRC developed a communicative richness, novel ways of expressing  

information and emotional meaning in relationship formation.   <p>

  

This thesis also explored, however, the nature of the presentation and  

perception of self in CMC in contrast to the relatively simple notions of self  

expressed in the relationship formation theories. It was suggested that the  

peculiar nature of CMC and its absence of physical presence, highlights the  

extent to which the self presented in relationships is relatively fluid depending  

on issues such as context. Using Goffman (1969) this thesis explored the  

various dimensions of the self on IRC.  <p>

  

It was also noted, however, that IRC like all communications technologies is  

inserted and developed in the context of existing social relations. It explored  

therefore the way in which traditional forms of power are negotiated on IRC  

focusing particularly on the question of gender but also the way in which new  

forms of power relations are developed through the new medium.  <p>

  

Despite the radical changes that CMC has brought in altering human  

communication and the formation of relationships, these processes are in fact  

reproductions of traditional forms of communication. Cyberspace will not be  

the means through which inherent inequalities and differences are broken  

down, but through the recognition by humans that no matter how they  

communicate they are bringing themselves to that act and that it is themselves  

that have to be changed.   <p>



The issues raised and discussed in the thesis are still important for  

understanding the use of CMC for human communication. Still, issues such  

as power and difference, especially in relation to gender need to be  

investigated further to gain a deeper understanding the complete impact that  

such a medium will have on human communication in the future.  <p>
