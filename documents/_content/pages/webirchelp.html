# EFNet #irchelp WebChat via chat.efnet.org

* The web client below will connect you directly to #irchelp on EFNet so you
  can ask your questions.
* Please just ask your question. It wastes time, and is considered rude to
  ask if you can ask a question first.
* Please be patient with us and keep when window open for a little while
  after you've asked your question - we might be doing other things, but we
  check back once in a while. Allow **at least an hour** if it seems really
  slow, and when someone sees your question, we'll try to help you.
* If you have an IRC client installed on your computer, you can also 
  <a href="irc://irc.efnet.org/irchelp">connect
  directly to irc.efnet.org and then /join #irchelp </a>
