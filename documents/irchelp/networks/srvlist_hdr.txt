AUTOMATICALLY UPDATED EFNET SERVER LIST

This list comes from a recent /links command. To use any of these servers,
just type something like this in any input area where you normally chat:
	/server irc.whatever.com

If you seem to have a lot of trouble connecting to many of these servers,
you should see our help file for connection problems at:
