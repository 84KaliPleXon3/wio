# No Software Downloads on IRCHelp.org

**As of 2014, IRCHelp.org will no longer host downloads of executable files on
this website. Going forward, we will point to official, canonical distribution pages where
available, or to well-known file distribution sites rather than hosting binaries.**

*Links which previously pointed to executable files are being redirected to
this page - if you got here from another page on this site, or from a link
on another site, that's probably why.*

# Why not?
There are a number of reasons for this policy. This site is run by a small
group of volunteers, and at times, we've experienced periods of neglect.
Our experience has been that keeping up-to-date mirrors of software is
a lot of work, and software downloads are already handled well by other sites,
including SourceForge, GitHub, and others for open source software, and Download.com
for commercial software. The second is security, under our current hosting arrangements,
we cannot offer an SSL website, so its difficult to insure that any binary
files we distributed are not tampered with as they travel over the internet.
