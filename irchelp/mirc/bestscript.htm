<p align="left"><font face="Arial"><b>Safe Scripts:</b></font></p>
<blockquote>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Where do you find safe
scripts?&nbsp; Well, if you don't understand mIRC scripting, you are at the mercy of
that scripts author.&nbsp; About all that is left is relying on someone else's
guidance.&nbsp; The best place to start if you are new to IRC and
just starting is finding a script archive website that<b> REVIEWS </b>the scripts they
host.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Just because a script site has been
around for quite awhile doesn't mean all the scripts there are safe.&nbsp; Over
the years I have seen both archive websites and very popular scripts go from
being useful and trustworthy to tools to hack your computer.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Some places I tend to use when
looking for scripts: <a href="http://www.irc-scripts.com/">IRC-SCRIPTS.COM</a> <a href="http://www.mircscripts.org/">MIRCSCRIPTS.ORG</a>
are a couple. Also the various well known #mIRC channels often have small script
  archives that are usually quite safe.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.mirc.org/">#mIRC
  (DALnet)</a> <a href="http://mirc.stealth.net/">#mIRC (EFnet)</a> 

<!--
Other script
  sites that I visit are listed on the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20030810131720/http://www.ircworks.com/">IRCworks
  </a>opening page.
-->

&nbsp; I do not <i> guarantee</i> any site to be safe, not
  even the ones I visit routinely, but I trust them enough to check out their
  offerings.&nbsp; You have to
  accept the responsibility for any script you choose to use, where ever you
  obtain that script from.&nbsp; The information here is simply a helpful guide,
  not a form of assurance.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">I used to visit www.mircx.com for scripts .. but I don't anymore .. guess why.&nbsp;</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial"><b>Kinds of Scripts:</b></font></p>
<blockquote>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Purpose:</b>&nbsp;</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"> There are thousands
of scripts with different purposes.&nbsp; Some people
want lots of colorful popups .. others want to control channel behavior .. the
next user wants to limit spam advertisements.&nbsp; The "best" script
is one that fits your needs.&nbsp; You have to decide what those are.&nbsp; What
exactly do you want the script to do for you?&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Full scripts handle lots of
different functions, usually including flood attack protection, file transfers,
marking you away when you are idle, and more.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Addon scripts are more specific in
purpose.&nbsp; A single addon script will handle setting you away, another addon
script will deal with floods or attacks.&nbsp; There are thousands of addon
scripts written for different purposes from fservers to memo handling.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Format:</b></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Scripts can be a single file,
usually with an mrc file extension.&nbsp; Normally that file can be written as a
"Remote" script.&nbsp; There are three script sections in mIRC:
Remotes, Aliases, and Popups. Remotes work without you needing to interact via
the keyboard or a mouse.&nbsp; Aliases are for keyboard shortcuts and Popups are
written for your mouse.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">However, as mIRC scripting advanced,
it became possible to add aliases and popups to a "remote"
script.&nbsp; This blurred the distinction between the three sections.&nbsp; For
more info on how the three sections work and are interrelated, read the current <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20030810131720/http://www.mirc.com/faq.html">mIRC
FAQ</a> and the mIRC Help file that came with your copy of mIRC.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial"><b>Signs of a Backdoor or Hacking in a
Script:</b></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Script features to be very very careful of
..&nbsp;</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">1. Any scripts (usually found
  bundled as zip or rar files) that include an associated file that ends with the
  extension <b>.exe</b> or .<b>bat</b>&nbsp; [Ed. note - many other extensions are also dangerous, for more information read all about <a href="../security/trojan.html">trojan horse viruses.</a> -Jolo]

  </font></p><p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"><font face="Arial" size="2">2. Scripts that force you to join
  a particular channel or message a specific user</font></font></p>
<font face="Arial" size="2">  </font><p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"><font face="Arial" size="2">3. Scripts that have /sockopen
  or any unexpected "Socket" components written into them.&nbsp; </font></font></p>
<font face="Arial" size="2">  </font><p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"><font face="Arial" size="2">4. Scripts that require you to use a .dll
  (dynamic link library) file that they provide. </font></font></p>
<font face="Arial" size="2">  </font><p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Also: Scripts that advertise themselves are, at best, rude and
  are more likely to have a backdoor.</font></p>
</blockquote>


<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Note that if you are looking for a
"socket based script" it will obviously have socket components in
it.&nbsp; The same for a dll based script.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My best advice for
new users is not to use these unless you can personally evaluate the script in
question or you have been around IRC long enough to know someone you can trust
that is expert enough to do it for you.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Popular scripts are sometimes
converted into backdoors and offered to new users.&nbsp; The same for popular
dll files.&nbsp; You spend some time on IRC and start seeing people use a
particular script, finally you find it at some
website.&nbsp; But the script you find may not be the one that was originally
written.&nbsp; A malicious individual may have taken the original
script or dll and added a virus feature to it and then reposted it.&nbsp; You
think you are getting the nice, safe original and the next thing you know you have
opened a door into your computer.&nbsp; So be careful.</font></p>
