This is a little remote that facilitates /who *domain searches to see
what servers allow a certain domain. It's the same as going through the
list of nicks manually and doing a /whois on each person to see what
servers they are using, but it generates a list of ALL the servers.
Thanks to EFnet James.

Put this in remotes (alt-r):

RAW 352:* {
  ECHO -s $5 $2 $6 $7 $3@ $+ $4 : $+ $8-
  IF ($5 !ISIN %Servers) %Servers = %Servers $5
  HALTDEF
}

Now do a /who search such as /who *.home.com  or /who *.aol.com, when it is
done scrolling the results, the list of servers will be held in the variable
%Servers. Just  //echo %Servers  to see the list of servers!

Don't forget to /unset %Servers  before starting a new search, or it will
just keep adding to the list of servers.
