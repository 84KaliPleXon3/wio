# DALnet
[DALnet](http://www.dal.net) started in 1994, and was the first of the major
networks to implement both nickname and channel registration, in the now familiar
form of nickserv and chanserv, making it immensely popular at the time for users
without the resources to maintain their identities and channels on the more
established EFNet and IRCNet networks, which, to this day, still offer no registration.
