<h3 align="center">IRC Networks</h3>

<p><a href="../servers/index.html">Server lists</a>. If you know the name
of the network already and just want to find some servers on that
network, skip right to our server lists.
<p><a href="../popular.html">Popular Nets</a>. Networks with over 10,000
users maximum. Combined, they account for over 90% of IRC usage. Certainly
the place(s) to go to just hang around and browse. Being the size they
are, they tend to be plagued by lag, splits, spam and general
stupidity much more than smaller ones. Still, for most people, one of
these is 'the place to be'.

<p><a href="medium.html">Medium-sized networks</a>. These are 'smaller
networks' which have grown up. As a rule, they offer the same kind of
service, but tend to look a bit more like the major nets. Networks with a
maximum usercount of 1,000 to 20,000 are listed in this category.

<p><a href="small.html">The smaller networks</a>. Networks with
under 1000 users maximum. Frequently created as alternatives to the major
nets, most of these networks attempt to avoid those problems which make
life tough on the large nets. As a rule, they will promise either no lag,
no splits, no oper abuse, no porn, no warez, yes warez, general
lawlessness or any combination of the above. Some of them are also pretty
successful and certainly are viable alternatives to the Big Four.

<p><a href="../subject.html">Subject and Special interest networks</a>. 
As an alternative to gathering on channels on one of the other smaller
or larger networks, some groups of people have set up their own networks,
dedicated to their cause, subject of interest or serving a
particular social group. Some are part of a larger internet presence
regarding their subject and may lead to much more information on it.

<p><a href="local.html">Local networks</a>. Does it have to be
'global'? The answer is No! Local and national networks are becoming
increasing popular, as they allow local server connections, especially
useful in areas with bad network connectivity, offer an environment where
the local language is predominant in the case of non-English speaking
countries and, of course, will be a place for discussing topics of local
interest. They vary in size, having five to 100 client servers and 200
to over 5000 users at their peak, some having more users from their domain
than are on all other networks combined. A welcome option for both locals
and expatriates. Some of them also have a server or two outside their
domain to accommodate foreign clients.
