<BR>Servers mainly around the pacific. Unlike most large networks, this
is one of the few that isn't US-based, but predominantly australasian. North American
all-nighters might find some signs of friendly life here.

<BR>A network formerly run entirely on Windows servers, which was a great novelty back then, this network has developed into a very decent alternative to the major ones. Showcase for the (commercial) Conference Room ircd.

<BR>Default port: 7000
<BR>Max users: &gt;23500

<BR>
Microsoft's own chat system, based on something called the Microsoft Exchange Chat Service. Formerly IRC- and web-based, as of May 2001, they require you to use their web link, which will prompt you to download their special client. Since you cannot connect to this network using a standard IRC client, we will no longer provide information on it, beyond simply pointing you to their own web site.

<P><A HREF="http://www.talkcity.com/">Talk City</A>
<BR>This is another large IRC/web-based chat network that has become unreasonably restrictive. As of April 2000, TalkCity required the use of specially modified versions of IRC clients such as mIRC for Windows, Ircle for Mac, etc. This was ostensibly to prevent abuse from people who were using customized "war scripts" to attack other users. Not surprisingly, the modified clients also came with annoying streaming ads, so you decide for yourself what their true intention was. Since this network can no longer be reached using standard IRC clients, we will no longer provide information on it, beyond simply pointing you to their own web site.
