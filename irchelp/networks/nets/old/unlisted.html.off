<h4 align="center">Problematic and unlisted networks</h4>

<p>Networks which aren't listed on any page along with an explanation for
their absence. An unreachable web site may not be a reason in itself for
removing a network, but I and users of these pages rely on them for
obtaining information such as servers to connect to, therefore their
presence is often essential. Some of the reasons were lost in an HD crash
and I couldn't quite remember...
<hr>

<p>UltraNet [http://www.ultranet.org/]<br>
Disappeared. All hosts in their domain are pointing to a single
unreachable address.

<p>TAIN [http://www.tain.org/]<br>
Their web site is once again pointing elsewhere. C'mon now, a bunch of
BOFHs can do better than that.

<p>OrionNet<br>
On my first visit to check it out, I was /kill'ed by some belligerent 
and arrogant member of their &quot;friendly and helpful staff&quot; for
an imagined offence. These pages aren't big enough for egos that size.

<p>Red Latina [http://www.ddnet.es/irc-latina/]<br>
The Spanish and Latin American parts separated in April and there has been
no news since. My spanish isn't up to understanding the relevant
documents.

<p>AsylumNet [http://www.asylumnet.org/]<br>
Their domain is also pointing elsewhere.

<p>AngelEyes Net [http://www.angeleyes.net/]<br>
Short-lived. Unreachable.

<p>TechnoNet [http://www.technonet.net/]<br>
One more MIA network.

<p>FireX [http://www.firex.org/]<br>
Ditto.

<p>SubNet [http://www.subirc.net/]<br>
Domain is gone, I presume the network has died along with it.

<p>QNet [http://www.irc.q.net/]<br>
Has gradually transformed into Openmind.

<p>LinuxNET<br>
Server list removed by request of LinuxNET administration, after the more
clueless kept ignoring the notice that it is NOT a help forum for Linux
newbies.

<p>BSDnet<br>
Server list removed. You don't want to be there anyway.

<p>LinPeople (LISC) [http://www.linpeople.org/]<br>
Open Projects Net is now their home.

<p>AnotherNet<br>
Replaced their IRC service with some commercial client/server thingy they
invented and are now asking for money to provide their services.

<p>ChatLink [http://www.chatlink.org/]<br>
Unable to connect to any of their servers with any means, including the
java page.

<p>PaganPaths [http://pagans.simplenet.com/paganpaths/]<br>
Never been able to connect to their web page, if they're still in
existence.

<p>Krono IRC Network [http://www.krono.net/]<br>
Network status didn't match the figures in their application and their
website is unreachable. Reapply.

<p>GWS<br>
Tried hard to find something better than a general description of IRC on
the corporate web site matching the URL they sent me. Reapply when you
have something better to present (like a list of servers...).

<p>KhronoNet<br>
Web site points to some web hosting company's front page. The whereabouts
of the IRC network itself are unknown.

<p>DVSnet<br>
The only way of reaching them is by reading the server list, which is
probably somewhere out there but definitely not at the URL they gave me.

<p>JailNet<br>
See previous entry.

<p>Phire.com<br>
Good luck to their web site, wherever it's disappeared to. I wonder if the
network followed it.

<!--
<p>NDRSNET<br>
Same as above.
-->

<p>RavenX.net [http://www.ravenx.net/]<br>
Information submitted matched neither the network status nor that on
their web site (the critique for which I'll keep to myself).

<p>PhantomNet [http://phantomnet.hypermart.net/]<br>
Sorry folks, but two dynamic IP servers don't quite qualify for addition.
I'm curious about all the references to NewNet on their web pages...

<p>Telepresence [http://www.cweb.co.nz/telepresence/]<br>
Too many (dyn.)ml.org addresses, friends. Do please get some name service
of your own.

<p>AirChat [http://www.airchat.net/]<br>
Web page lists two unreachable servers. Attempts to connect through
irc.airchat.net (which had ten addresses) eventually resulted in a
connection to some other network. Obviously their level of organization
is short of standards...

<p>IrvingNet [http://www.kpac.com/IrvingNet/]<br>
One static and one dynamic server. Please reapply when you have a more
stable structure.

<p>LunaNet [http://www.lunanet.eu.org/]<br>
Nice page. Now how about adding a server list to it so people can
actually reach the network?

<p>Megachat.net [http://www.megachat.net/irc/]<br>
Dear webmaster,<br>
If you don't have time to maintain a server list for your network, as you
say, imagine me.

<p>HeatNET<br>
Please reapply with an URL for a server list that actually exists.

<p>Tekneeks<br>
Same as above.

<p>OrbitLink<br>
Please reapply when your website consists of more than a mailto: and four
frames of graphics.

<p>StarTalk (ex-LarisaNet)<br>
Erm... sorry folks but I misplaced your application. Please resend.

<p>Starvision [http://www.starvision.org/]<br>
Expecting revision of their server list before adding them.
<hr>
<h3>Hall Of Shame</h3>
<p>The following networks are blacklisted due to their opers or admins 
spamming ads for them on other networks. Those which were on the list have
been removed. The rest needn't ask to be added.
<p>CobraNet (Removed)<br>
SolarChat<br>
649.org<br>
SPEEDnet<br>
GammaForce (Previously removed for other reasons)<br>
Chosen.Net
