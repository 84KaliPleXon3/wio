# IRCX
[IRCx](https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-pfenning-irc-extensions-04.txt) was a
set of extensions to the IRC protocol used by several Microsoft implementations
of IRC.

On the server side, IRCX incorported a number of unique featurs, including channel
properties/metadata, multilingual support, UTF-8 nicknames and channel names
(represented as hexadecimal to legacy clients),  and tiered channel permission levels
(owner, host, voice).

IRCX was originally implemented in Microsoft Exchange 5.5 to replace the propriatary
Microsoft Chat, and was also available in Microsoft Exchange 2000. A third party
IRCD called [TESX](http://www.squarish.net/tesx/) also implements  the IRCx protocol
but is likewise abandoned.

On the client end, IRCx was implemented within the much-maligned and now discontinued
Microsoft Comic Chat, which was included with Internet Explorer 3, 4, and 5.
