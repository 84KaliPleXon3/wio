The dmsetup.exe Trojan horse attack

WHAT IS DMSETUP.EXE?

To put it plainly dmsetup.exe is a file (if you are silly enough to
run it) that copies itself in several places on your hard disk,
makes its own mirc.ini and associated script and adds to a system
file to ensure it cannot be purged easily.

All the script does (so far) is send itself to people when they join
and make the person who has it /quit from IRC on a certain keyword.

This file affects at least mIRC 5.11 and 5.31 (the latest version),
so unlike the original script.ini attack, upgrading is not the
solution.

As a rule we should NEVER accept or run any programs that we don't
know. Treat dmsetup.exe just like a nasty VIRUS.

To fix this problem, there are 2 main scenarios, depending on
whether you have mIRC in the C drive or not. We highly recommend you
work through the following steps, because it's much better to make
sure you've eradicated the problem, plus you're more likely to be
reading the latest, most up to date fixes here.

If all else fails, or if all of this is meaningless tech-speak and
you can't find a friend to walk you through the steps, you may
choose to try downloading a command file which you may find at:
	http://www.mirc.bay-city.net/dmremove.html
which you then run, and hope it does all of this for you. You really
should use that only as a last resort!

IF YOU HAVE MIRC INSTALLED ON YOUR C: DRIVE...


In other words if you have c:\mirc\

1st time dmsetup.exe is run

1.	It copies itself to c:\
                        c:\mirc
                        c:\windows
                        c:\program files
    but it DOES NOT copy itself to anywhere else.

2.	It then creates c:\configg.sys (reason explained later).

3.	Then it adds dmsetup line to autoexec.bat (this can be seen with
	a text editor).

4.	It copies mirc.ini to backup0412.ini

5.	Creates mirc.ini and mircrem.ini

6.	Displays error type 0 (so that you think the download is broken).

2nd 3rd 4th ... time it is run

It does all the above steps exactly the same except 2 & 3 due to the
existance of configg.sys (unsure whether its contents are relevent) 

Recommended course of action

1.	Unload mircrem.ini

2.	Open c:\autoexec.bat with notepad and remove the dmsetup line -
	save and exit

3.	Delete the following
        c:\dmsetup.exe
        c:\configg.sys
        c:\mirc\dmsetup.exe
        c:\mirc\mircrem.ini
        c:\mirc\backup0412.ini
        c:\windows\dmsetup.exe
        c:\progra~1\dmsetup.exe

I have not included mirc.ini because once mircrem.ini is gone mirc resets
the one line in this that was of any harm - I'll leave the choice up to
you. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IF YOU HAVE DO NOT HAVE MIRC INSTALLED ON YOUR C: DRIVE...

The attack performs steps 1 to 3 above, then returns error type 1.

There is a differnce in step 1 however - because the c:\mirc
directory doesn't exist it copies itself into mirc (no extension) on
the root drive.

Because it didn't alter mirc.ini, the people won't even know they have
it nor will anyone else either, unless they check out of curiosity or
until they put mIRC on the c: drive.

Recommended course of action

1.	Open c:\autoexec.bat with notepad and remove the dmsetup line -
	save and exit

2.	Delete the following
        c:\dmsetup.exe
        c:\configg.sys
        c:\mirc
        c:\windows\dmsetup.exe
        c:\progra~1\dmsetup.exe

You should have eradicated the dmsetup attack now. Please take some
time to read the other help files at:

to make sure you are not infected with other similar trojan horse
attacks, and to make sure you don't get infected again in the
future.
