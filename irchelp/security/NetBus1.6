First we need to find the name of NetBus on your system.
By default this is Patch.exe, but can be renamed easily to almost
anything, and it need not end in .exe

WARNING:  Before making ANY changes to your systems registry, you
should backup your registry (using the Export command in the registry
menu), and Do Not edit or delete anything Other than what is
recommended here.

By using RegEdit, locate the key :

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run

After clicking on  Run  the right hand panel will change.
There will be a list of items, in two columns.
In the first column, there will be a key which loads the program.
Most likely there will be many other keys as well, the first of which
is  (Default)     Do NOT delete any other keys except for the ones below.

The default key name is PATCH, which would look like

PATCH,       "C:\windows\patch.exe /nomsg"

Its possible that NetBus will have a different name than  patch.exe
However the lines for NetBus WILL ALWAYS end with   /nomsg   and this is
how you can be sure you have the right ones.
Make a note of any and all items ending with /nomsg, and then delete
these from the registry by right clicking on the key (left column)
and choosing delete.

Once you remove this from the registry, you can reboot.
This will remove the program from memory.

After you reboot, you can use Windows Explorer and find the files
you noted in the registry.  Do not run any of these files!  Delete them
and right after empty your recycle bin.
Additionaly some find it easier to reboot into DOS, and from there
delete the files, and reboot again back into windows.

You should now be uninfected, however you may want to use our webpages, or
join #netsplit of EFNet to check again.

--OR--

An easier approach, could be to telnet to your own system (localhost)
port 12345, and send the commands to the server to make
it delete itself.

Run telnet and in the connect menu, choose remote host.
For host type  localhost   and for port type  12345

It should answer with   NetBus 1.60   or  NetBus 1.60 x
(The x at the end means there is a password set on your server.
Fortunately there is a way around the NetBus password.)

Type the following two lines :

Password;1;
RemoveServer;1

You most likely wont beable to see your own typing, so you may
want to copy/paste.


This will remove the program from memory and fix the registry,
however it wont remove NetBus from your HD.
Unfortunatly using this method you cant find the path to the file(s)
to delete, however if method #1 fails you, this may be the only option.
