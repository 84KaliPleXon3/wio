NetBus 1.5x was designed to be hard to find and remove.  We also have
very little information on this version of NetBus, but believe all the 
information below to be correct.

By default, this copy of netbus installs at
C:\windows\sysedit.exe

WARNING
C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM\SYSEDIT.EXE      is a REAL windows program that MUST
NOT BE deleted.  NetBus installs into C:\WINDOWS\  and uses the same
name in hopes to confuse the user into not knowing which to delete.


WARNING:  Before making ANY changes to your systems registry, you
should backup your registry (using the Export command in the registry
menu), and Do Not edit or delete anything Other than what is
recommended here.

By using RegEdit, locate the key :

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run

After clicking on  Run  the right hand panel will change.
There will be a list of items, in two columns.
In the first column, there will be a key which loads the program.
Most likely there will be many other keys as well, the first of which
is  (Default)     Do NOT delete any other keys except for the ones below.

The key name could be almost anything, but by default is SYSEDIT

SYSEDIT,       "C:\windows\sysedit.exe /nomsg"

Its possible that NetBus will have a different name than sysedit.exe
However the lines for NetBus WILL ALWAYS end with   /nomsg   and this is
how you can be sure you have the right ones.
Make a note of any and all items ending with /nomsg, and then delete
these from the registry by right clicking on the key (left column)
and choosing delete.

Once you remove this from the registry, you can reboot.
This will remove the program from memory.

After you reboot, you can use Windows Explorer and find the files
you noted in the registry.  Do not run any of these files!  Delete them
and right after empty your recycle bin.
Additionaly some find it easier to reboot into DOS, and from there
delete the files, and reboot again back into windows.

You should now be uninfected, however you may want to use our webpages, or
join #netsplit of EFNet to check again.
