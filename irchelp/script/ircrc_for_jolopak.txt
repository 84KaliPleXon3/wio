## last updated: 10/22/00 with JoloPak 1.4
## This file doesn't change with each JoloPak because it is just an example
## of an .ircrc setup file which lets you install or upgrade to the latest
## jolopak.scr with no changes, instead putting all custom changes here.
## Many lines are commented out, delete the leading #'s to activate a line.

## INSTALLATION (3 easy steps):
##   1. Save the file as .ircrc in your shell account home directory.
##      Also put the main JoloPak file jolopak.scr in the same place.
##		(If you have older versions of either file, back them up first!)
##   2. Personalize "myversion", "myhome" and "myuserinfo" below.
##   3. If you installed ircII yourself, verify the LOAD_PATH and HELP_PATH.
##   Now Launch ircII as usual (usually type "irc") -- that's it!

## Put your home directory or where you saved jolopak.scr if different
## after 'myhome' below. To find your home directory, at the UNIX prompt
## type "echo $HOME", or "cd" followed by "pwd".

assign myhome /home/jyl

## Change "ircII..." below to whatever version you are running. To find
## your version, launch IRC by "irc -q", then /CTCP your_nick VERSION, copy
## everything after "CTCP VERSION reply from your_nick:". When in doubt,
## don't tamper with this, and don't get cute or you risk getting /kill'd.

assign myversion ircII 2.8.2 SunOS 5.8

## The next long line is returned to anybody doing /ctcp your_nick userinfo
## This is your chance to be creative - don't mess with other CTCP responses!
## This is my actual userinfo, just to show you an example. :)

assign myuserinfo Jack Smith, I enjoy Broadway musicals and violent movies, please see my web site at http://blah

## Now that you've customized your ircII properly, load the JoloPak script
## Don't change this line or move it elsewhere!!!

eval LOAD $myhome/jolopak.scr

## That's pretty much it, anything after this is purely optional!
## From here on you can add any further customizations. All of these
## examples are commented out. To activate them, delete the leading "#"
## symbol from each line beginning with just 1 "#".

## If you have problems with /load, uncomment and change the following
## to suit your needs.  Here's what to do if the default ircII directories
## change from /usr/local/ to the "myhome" directory that you set earlier.

#eval SET LOAD_PATH .:$myhome:$myhome/script:$myhome/lib/irc/script
#eval SET HELP_PATH $myhome/lib/irc/help

## If you do change LOAD_PATH above, uncomment the following 2 lines
## so that you reload these standard scripts using your correct LOAD_PATH

#LOAD tabkey
#LOAD killpath

## We're all done now. You can add customizations at the end of this file,
## or make a new file like "Private" and use it by uncommentng the next line:

#eval LOAD $myhome/Private

## All the following lines are examples of how to customize JoloPak, you
## may toggle their action by commenting or uncommenting the lines.

## if uncommented, turn off auto recording of /msg's when you are away

#^assign record_when_away NO

## if uncommented, turn off the auto /away if you idle for 15 min

#ON ^IDLE -15

## if uncommented, enable delayed auto_rejoin after you get kicked. Note
## some channels consider auto rejoin to be annoying and you may get banned!

autorejoin on
