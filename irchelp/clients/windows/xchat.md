# XChat

XChat is easily the most popular of the X11 clients - it's lightweight, scriptable in multiple languages, and has sensible defaults. XChat is an open source project developed under the GPL, and although primarily developed as a Unix/Linux client, ports exist for other platforms.

XChat supports a binary plugin API, in which addons can be written in C or C++, and several scripting languages including Perl, Python, TCL and others are supported through the plugin architecture.

XChat is included in a number of Linux distributions, either as part of the base system or as part of official package repositories.


## Official Windows Port

XChat has long offered an official Windows port. Originally, the Windows version was freely distributed, but since 2004 the official builds have been offered under a shareware license, even though the source code remains freely available under GPL.

Unlike users of Linux and other Unix-like operating systems, the majority of Windows users do not readily have access to development tools, or have the technical know-how to build a program designed for X11 as a native Windows application. Most Windows users therefore have to rely on the developer or third parties (see below) to distribute binaries.



## Unofficial Builds, Ports and Other Derivatives

Controversy over the devision to license the Windows port of XChat as shareware led to a number of unofficial builds for Windows users, at least one of which grew into a fork of XChat.


### HexChat
[HexChat](/irchelp/clients/unix/xchat/hexchat.html) originally sprung out of the shareware controversy, starting as the unofficial Windows port XChat-WDK, which was renamed HexChat and became a fork in its own right.

HexChat is now offered on Unix/Linux systems as well as Windows. HexChat has become the more actively developed than XChat while maintaining close compatibility, with frequent releases and new features.
