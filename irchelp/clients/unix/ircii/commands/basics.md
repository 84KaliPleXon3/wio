# Basics
Irc is a multi-user, multi-channel chatting network.  It allows
people all over the internet to talk to one another in real-time.
Each irc user has a nickname they use.  All communication with
another user is either by nickname or by the channel that they or
you are on.  All IRCII commands begin with a / character.
Anything that does not begin with a / is assumed to be a message
that is sent to everyone on your channel. 

Here is a list of basic commands to help you get started:

* [/LIST](./list.html) Lists all current irc channels, number of
    users, and topic.
* [/NAMES](./names.html) Shows the nicknames of all users on each
    channel
* [/JOIN](./join.html) <channel> Join the named channel.  All non-commands
    you type will now go to everyone on that channel
* [/MSG](./msg.html) <nick> <msg> Sends a private message to the specified
    person.  Only the specified nickname will see this message.
* [/NICK](./nick.html) Change your nickname
* [/QUIT](./quit.html) Exits irc.
* [/HELP](./help.html) <topic>	Gets help on all IRCII commands.
* [/WHO](./who.html) <channel> Shows who is on a given channel, including nickname, user name and host,
    and realname.
* [/WHOIS](./whois.html) <nick>	Shows the "true" indentity of someone

These commands should get you started on irc.  Use the /HELP
command to find out more about things on irc, or ask someone...
most would be happy to help you out.
