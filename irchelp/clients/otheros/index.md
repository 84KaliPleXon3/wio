This is a catch-all for desktop operating systems other than Windows, Mac OS
X, and Linux/Unix,

## Haiku
[Vision](https://sourceforge.net/projects/vision/) is a native BeOS/Haiku IRC client.

In addition, a number of the Unix clients, such as [irssi](/irchelp/clients/unix/irssi.html) have been ported to Haiku.
