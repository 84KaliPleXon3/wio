# IRC Clients for Other Operating Systems

This is a catch-all for desktop operating systems other than Windows, Mac OS
X, and Linux/Unix,

## Haiku
[Vision](https://sourceforge.net/projects/vision/) is a native BeOS/Haiku IRC client.

In addition, a number of the Unix clients, such as [irssi](/irchelp/clients/unix/irssi.html) have been ported to Haiku.

## MS-DOS
The mTCP suite of applications includes [IRCjr](http://www.brutman.com/mTCP/IRCjr.html), a basic IRC client for MS-DOS systems, which can even run within [DOSBox](http://www.dosbox.com/).
