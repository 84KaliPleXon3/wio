# Instant Messaging programs on MacOS X

Although not designed specifically for IRC, many instant messageing programs
have at least basic IRC support.

The IRC support in instant messaging programs is more than enough to join a
channel and chat, but the interface and features may be lacking for more
advanced users.

## Adium

Adium is a popular open source instant message program for Mac OS X, which
maintains close parity and shared code with Pidgin.
