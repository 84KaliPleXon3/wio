# Guidelines for irchelp.org authors.


* * *

## Introduction

This site is run by a group of volunteers primarily consisting of the ops from the #irchelp channel on EFNet. We welcome contributions to the site, but have a number of guidelines which you should
follow so that your content can be easily included into the site.


## Technical Requirements

As of 2012, all content on the site is maintained as Markdown files with a short YAML header containing metadata. Markdown is a simple way of adding formatting to text files, very similar to wiki markup.

## Content Guidelines
  * We are not a software hosting site. No executables or archive files will be hosted - links should be provided to landing pages for stable and canonical download locations for any software mentioned on the site.
  * We are aiming to be as network-agnostic as possible. In the past, IRCHelp.org was EFNet and IRCNet centric, we are in the process of changing that.

## Legal Requirements

  * Content must either be your own work, or under an acceptable free documentation license, or we can't host it.
  * For content you have created yourself, we ask that you either release it under one of our acceptable licenses, listed below, or provide a release giving us a royalty-free, perpetual right to publish your content on our website.

### Acceptable Licenses
  * CC-BY
  * CC-BY-SA
  * GFDL
  * Public Domain
  * Others?
