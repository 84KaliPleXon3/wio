              <h1><a name=Abs>Abstract:</a></h1>
              This paper discusses interaction on 'Internet Relay Chat', the synchronous 
              computer-mediated communication system available on that network. 
              It is shown that the structure of IRC forces users to deconstruct 
              many of the cultural tools that form the basis of more conventional 
              systems of interaction. Within this environment new methods of creating 
              shared systems of significance, and methods of enforcing that new 
              hegemony, have developed. IRC's internal system of cultural deconstruction 
              and regeneration is mirrored in its implications for the external 
              system of academic discourse. It is proposed that the forms of interaction 
              seen on IRC problematize and necessitate the reconstruction of some 
              of the methods of analysis that have been applied to computer-mediated 
              communication. IRC - and computer-mediated communication in general 
              - offer challenges to disciplines such as linguistics, sociology 
              and history that demand a reconstruction of those discourses.

              <h1><a name=Pref>Preface:<br>
                Computer-Mediated Communication</a></h1>
              Despite the recent innovations of radio and telecommunications, 
              communication and language theorists make a sharp distinction between 
              the spoken and the written word. That distinction is based on a 
              perception of temporal and spatial proximity in the case of spoken 
              communication, and distance in the case of written communication. 
              "Most analyses of linguistic interaction," as Naomi Baron notes, 
              "are based on the paradigm of two people speaking face-to-face."<a 
href="http://www.crosswinds.net/~aluluei/electropolis.htm#note1">(1)</a> It is 
              further assumed that alternative methods of communication - telephones 
              and letters for example - supplement, as Baron expresses it, 'normal' 
              face-to-face communication.<a 
href="http://www.crosswinds.net/~aluluei/electropolis.htm#note2">(2)</a> The underlying 
              assumption that physical contact is necessarily a part of human 
              communication pervades social theory. This is understandable. Until 
              recently, physical contact was almost always a prerequisite for 
              communication, with letters mainly being transmitted between people 
              who had met in the flesh. Even the telephone assumes physical contact. 
              It is generally only in the business world that people phone others 
              whom they have not met, and personal telephone conversations are, 
              as in the case of letters, conducted between people who are already 
              known to each other. 
              <p>The technology of computer-mediated communication offers an alternative 
                to this. Computer-mediated communications systems (CMCS's) use 
                computers and telecommunications networks to compose, store, deliver 
                and process communication. There are three basic types of computer-mediated 
                communication systems: email, news, and chat programs. 'Email', 
                or electronic mail, allows users of computer systems to send messages 
                to each other. 'News' allows users to send messages to a database 
                divided under subject headings, facilitating electronic mail between 
                multiple users on diverse subjects. These two types of communication 
                are asynchronous - messages, whether private email or public news, 
                can be created and received at widely separated times, allowing 
                time for reflection and deliberation in response. The third type 
                of CMCS is the chat program, which does not store messages but 
                transmits one person's typing directly to the monitor of another 
                person or group of people. Chat programs deal in a form of synchronous 
                communication that defies conventional understandings of the differences 
                between spoken and written language. 
              <p>CMCS's are a recent development, with widespread availability 
                only becoming possible within the last decade. Consequently, little 
                has been written about them outside of technical considerations 
                of their design and implementation. The few articles that have 
                addressed the subject tend to do so from a commercial orientation 
                - discussing the impact of CMC on problem solving techniques, 
                office communication and corporate structure.<a 
href="http://www.crosswinds.net/~aluluei/electropolis.htm#note3">(3)</a> An assumption 
                that is commonly made by researchers of computer-mediated communication 
                is that the medium is not conducive to emotional exchanges. As 
                Ronald Rice and Gail Love state, "the typical conclusion is that 
                as [the communication] bandwidth narrows, media allow less 'social 
                presence'; communication is likely to be described as less friendly, 
                emotional, or personal and more serious, business-like and task 
                oriented."<a 
href="http://www.crosswinds.net/~aluluei/electropolis.htm#note4">(4)</a> This 
                may have been found to be the case in some instances, and may 
                reflect the overall concern among researchers to study CMC in 
                a business environment. But computer-mediated communication systems 
                are not - either theoretically or in practice - limited to commercial 
                use. It is also possible to use them for social interaction. Internet 
                Relay Chat is one such system. IRC is a multi-user synchronous 
                communication facility that is available all over the world to 
                people with access to the 'Internet' network of computer systems. 
                IRC was not specifically designed for a business environment - 
                the use to which it is put is entirely decided by those who use 
                it. Work is certainly done on IRC. It is an excellent forum for 
                consultations between workers on different points of the globe 
                - everything from programming to translation to authorial collaboration 
                goes on on IRC. However, a large part of what goes on on IRC is 
                not work but play, and it is this aspect of it that I will address. 
              <p>Communication using the Internet Relay Chat program is written, 
                and users are spatially distant, but it is also synchronous. It 
                is a written - or rather, typed - form of communication that is 
                transmitted, received and responded to within a time frame that 
                has formerly been only thought relevant to spoken communication. 
                IRC does not assume physical contact between users - either prior 
                to or after communication via computer. Users of the system will, 
                as the medium is international, know in person at most only a 
                few fellow users. IRC allows - encourages - recreational communication 
                between people who have never been, most likely will never be, 
                in a situation to base their knowledge of each other and their 
                methods of communication on physical cues. 
              <p>Users of IRC do not, however, have no knowledge of each other. 
                The people who make up the IRC community are effectively preselected 
                by external social structures - access to IRC is restricted to 
                those who have access to the Internet computer network. There 
                are many such people - the Internet spans countries as diverse 
                as Germany, the United States, Japan, Israel, Australia and Korea. 
                However, those individuals who use IRC will be in an economically 
                privileged position in their society. They have access to high 
                technology. Due to the nature of the computer network on which 
                IRC runs, the Internet, they will most likely be members of an 
                academic community, often students of computer science.<a 
href="http://www.crosswinds.net/~aluluei/electropolis.htm#note5">(5)</a> Interaction 
                on IRC is then carried out in the knowledge that users are on 
                a rough equality - according to conventional economic measures 
                - and members of similarly privileged social groups. This 'equality' 
                is not intrinsic to IRC, it is a by-product of the social structures 
                surrounding computer technology. 
              <p>Nevertheless, IRC provides a unique field to the social theorist. 
                It challenges and forces an escape from traditional paradigms 
                of social interaction by reference to an architecture that allows 
                relative anonymity. It stands as a challenge to the methods of 
                analysis that have been directed at computer-mediated communication 
                systems. IRC was not designed to perform a corporate function, 
                nor has it come to do so. It was intended to be a tool for social 
                interaction between spatially disparate people, and as such it 
                cannot be completely explained or analysed by reference to the 
                methods used by other CMC theorists.<a 
href="http://www.crosswinds.net/~aluluei/electropolis.htm#note6">(6)</a> 
              <p>Interaction on IRC involves a deconstruction of traditional assumptions 
                about the dynamics of communication, and the construction of alternative 
                systems. IRC is essentially a playground. Within its domain people 
                are free to experiment with different forms of communication and 
                self-representation. Within IRC, "Power is challenged and supplanted 
                by rituals combining both destruction and rejuvenation."<a 
href="http://www.crosswinds.net/~aluluei/electropolis.htm#note7">(7)</a> To paraphrase 
                F.R. Ankersmit, users of IRC do not shape themselves according 
                to or in conformity with the conventions of social contexts external 
                to the medium, but learn to "play" their "cultural game" with 
                them.<a 
href="http://www.crosswinds.net/~aluluei/electropolis.htm#note8">(8)</a> 
              <p>This is my central thesis, and I will seek to address it from 
                two perspectives. My first concern will be the methods by which 
                users of IRC utilise the medium in the deconstruction of social 
                boundaries. As I have suggested, users of IRC are a pre-selected 
                community - they have much in common as far as such considerations 
                as social position and education are concerned. IRC, however, 
                presents unique problems for the expression of this community. 
                The methods by which such groups are usually held together rely 
                on physical proximity. These methods are not open to users of 
                IRC - computer-mediated communication challenges and deconstructs 
                these social tools. I will discuss the means by which communication 
                on IRC does this. My second concern is the construction of alternative 
                communities on IRC. Denied or having deconstructed the more traditional 
                methods of sustaining a community, users of IRC must develop alternative 
                or parallel methods. Both positive and negative methods of sustaining 
                community are developed on IRC. Computer-mediated rewards and 
                punishments are developed, and complex rituals have evolved to 
                keep users within the IRC 'fold' and to regulate the use of authority. 
              <p>Discussion of these points will lead to a presentation of the 
                social discourse of IRC. The challenging of the power of social 
                norms and their replacement with rituals combining both destruction 
                and rejuvenation, brings into play areas of discourse that are 
                postmodern. This connection between postmodernism and that phase 
                of culture and technology marked by computerisation has been remarked 
                upon by even those antipathetic to the discourse. Perez Zagorin 
                describes postmodernism as "a fundamental mutation in the sphere 
                of culture reflecting the new multinational phase of... [the] 
                electronic society."<a 
href="http://www.crosswinds.net/~aluluei/electropolis.htm#note9">(9)</a> Culture, 
                as defined by Schneider, is a "system of symbols and meanings."<a 
href="http://www.crosswinds.net/~aluluei/electropolis.htm#note10">(10)</a> Since 
                computer-mediated communication systems are "designed specifically 
                to affect the transmission of symbols and meanings", IRC - which 
                is both international and electronic - has the potential to alter 
                understandings of cultural analysis.<a 
href="http://www.crosswinds.net/~aluluei/electropolis.htm#note11">(11)</a> My 
                conclusion is that Internet Relay Chat, by deconstructing social 
                boundaries and by the ways in which users construct their own 
                community and culture, is a postmodern phenomenon. 
              <p>Cultural criticism in this postmodern age is, as Alan Lui states, 
                governed by "its belief that criticism can, and must, engage with 
                context".<a 
href="http://www.crosswinds.net/~aluluei/electropolis.htm#note12">(12)</a> It 
                is also, as Ankersmit suggests, reflexive, self- referential.<a 
href="http://www.crosswinds.net/~aluluei/electropolis.htm#note13">(13)</a> If 
                history is to be able to address the questions raised by computer-mediated 
                culture, then historians must examine the impact of that cultural 
                context upon their craft. Historians must ask what will happen 
                to the practice of history when "societies enter what is known 
                as the postindustrial age and cultures enter what is known as 
                the postmodern age"?<a 
href="http://www.crosswinds.net/~aluluei/electropolis.htm#note14">(14)</a> If 
                computer-mediated communication problematises cultural criticism 
                by questioning conventional notions about the construction of 
                the self and of culture, then it also problematises historiography. 
                If historians continue to take to the increasingly more complex 
                forms of computerised information exchange that are being developed 
                then these factors will have ideological implications for their 
                craft. What will happen to the relationship of the historian to 
                his text, and what will happen to the historian's view of texts, 
                once electronic data itself becomes subject to historical study? 
              <p>The most prosaic aspects of the historian's craft are challenged 
                in a computer-mediated culture. If primary and secondary sources 
                are produced and disseminated electronically, what becomes of 
                the conventions of citation?<a 
href="http://www.crosswinds.net/~aluluei/electropolis.htm#note15">(15)</a> Under 
                the application of this technology, historical texts become subject 
                to, as Lyotard describes it, an "exteriorization of knowledge 
                with respect to the 'knower'"<a 
href="http://www.crosswinds.net/~aluluei/electropolis.htm#note16">(16)</a> The 
                form which computerised knowledge takes - electronic encoding, 
                or data files - is not inherently identifiable with its creator. 
                Electronic data can be modified by anyone who has the appropriate 
                technology. It is subject to a fluidity that 'hard copy' is not 
                - it can be changed without that change being detectable. The 
                context of information changes the relationship between information 
                and power, between information and discourse. As John Perry Barlow 
                asks, "What are data and what is free speech? How does one treat 
                property which has no physical form and can be infinitely reproduced? 
                Is a computer the same as a printing press?... Can anyone morally 
                claim to own knowledge itself?"<a 
href="http://www.crosswinds.net/~aluluei/electropolis.htm#note17">(17)</a> 
              <p>In examining the Internet Relay Chat computer-mediated communication 
                system I attempt to write history within the context of the culture 
                of an electronic, postindustrial, postmodern society.

              <h1><a name=Intro>Introduction:<br>
                AARNet, the Internet and IRC</a></h1>
              Most people are familiar with personal computers. Although only 
              a small number are conversant with the technical details of microcomputer 
              technology, or with computer programming languages, most people 
              have a rough idea of what a computer looks like, and that they are 
              used by typing commands into a keyboard and viewing feedback from 
              the machine on a monitor. Word processing has become so common that 
              it would be hard to find a person living in the Western world - 
              especially in an academic community - who had not actually used 
              a computer. 
              <p>Throughout this essay I shall assume a basic understanding of 
                the physical act of computer use. I do not intend to explain any 
                of the technical details pertaining to my subject - most of them 
                are, at any rate, beyond my understanding. However I feel that 
                it would be useful to give some explanation of the historical 
                context within which Internet Relay Chat has been developed, and 
                necessary to offer a description of the IRC environment. 
              <p> 
              <h2>ARPANET, the Internet and AARNet</h2>
              <a 
href="http://www.crosswinds.net/~aluluei/electropolis.htm#note18">(18)</a> The 
              personal computers with which most readers will be familiar - IBM 
              compatibles, Apple Macintoshes, Amigas and so on - are a relatively 
              recent phenomenon. It is only within the last ten to twenty years 
              that computers have become household items. Before that computing 
              was the domain of governmental or commercial organisations which 
              owned large - mainframe - computer systems. As usage of these systems 
              increased, it became common for computers at one geographical location, 
              or site, to be linked together so that users on each could have 
              access to the data and facilities contained on all the others. These 
              local area networks, or LANs, developed into networks connecting 
              machines at dispersed sites, utilising the telephone line system. 
              The first of these 'long-haul' networks was the ARPANET, which came 
              into existence in 1969. This project was funded by the Advanced 
              Research Projects Agency, an arm of the United States Department 
              of Defence. ARPANET initially connected machines at the University 
              of California (Los Angeles and Santa Barbara campuses) and the University 
              of Utah, and was intended to facilitate research at those sites. 
              Along the idea of sharing electronic data went the idea of communication 
              between users. ARPANET originally allowed two methods of communication 
              between users - email and news. 
              <p>ARPANET's membership grew, with many other educational institutions 
                in the United States adopting the new technology. In 1983 ARPANET 
                was divided into two networks, known as ARPANET (for research 
                use) and MILNET (for military use). The ARPANET arm continued 
                to grow, with local area networks at various government, educational 
                and commercial sites being added to the system. With the advent 
                of satellite communications, it became possible for computers 
                in other countries to join the network, and ARPANET became known 
                as the Internet. Technically, the Internet is not one network, 
                but a number of networks that communicate with each other, however 
                to the user it appears to be one big network. 
              <p>The Australian arm of the Internet is known as AARNet, the Australian 
                Academic Research Network. AARNet grew out of ACSnet, the Australian 
                Computer Science Network, which served to connect computers used 
                directly by computer science researchers. Initially this network 
                was linked by conventional telephone lines, with machines exchanging 
                data and mail each night. This has developed into a nationwide 
                system permanently linking virtually all computers at major academic 
                institutions, and some commercial and government research organisations. 
                Initially a link to the Internet was run via undersea cables to 
                Hawaii, but in early July 1990 the final links were installed 
                to make AARNet fully operational, and operation of a satellite 
                connection to the United States West Coast segment of the Internet 
                was commenced. 
              <p>The most heavily used forms of inter-user communication on the 
                Internet are still the asynchronous forms of email and news. On 
                most computers on the Internet synchronous communication is possible 
                using a program that enables two users to type directly to each 
                others' screens, thus having a real-time electronically mediated 
                conversation. This method of communication is, however, fairly 
                limited - only two people can 'talk' to each other at once. 
              <p>It was in response to the limitations of the synchronous communication 
                programs in existence that Jarkko Oikarinen decided to write a 
                computer program that would enable multiple users to engage in 
                synchronous communication across a network. This project was known 
                as Internet Relay Chat. 
              <p> 
              <h2>Internet Relay Chat</h2>
              <a 
href="http://www.crosswinds.net/~aluluei/electropolis.htm#note19">(19)</a> Jarkko 
              Oikarinen wrote the original IRC program at the University of Oulu, 
              Finland, in 1988. He designed IRC as a 'client-server' program. 
              The user runs a 'client' program from his or her local machine, 
              which then connects, via the Internet, to a 'server' program which 
              may not be running on that local machine. There are hundreds of 
              IRC 'servers' over the world, all of which communicate with each 
              other and pass information back to the client programs - and users 
              - connected to them. IRC was first tested on a single machine with 
              less than twenty users participating. IRC's networking capabilities 
              were then tested on a suite of three machines in southern Finland. 
              Once tested it was installed throughout the Finnish national network 
              - FUNET - and then connected to NORDUNET, the Scandinavian branch 
              of the Internet. By November of 1988, IRC had spread across the 
              Internet. The latest listing of countries whose Internet branches 
              host IRC include Australia, the United States, Italy, Israel and 
              Korea.<a 
href="http://www.crosswinds.net/~aluluei/electropolis.htm#note20">(20)</a> 
              <p>IRC differs significantly from previous synchronous communication 
                programs. Fundamental to IRC is the concept of a channel. 'Talk', 
                'chat' and 'voice' had no need of such a concept since only two 
                people could communicate at one time, typing directly to each 
                other's screen. On IRC however, where two or three hundred users 
                is the normal population, such a system would create chaos. It 
                was therefore necessary to devise some way of allowing users to 
                decide whose activity they wanted to see and who they wanted to 
                make aware of their own activity. 'Channels' were the answer. 
                On entering the IRC program, the user is not at first able to 
                see the activity of other connected users. To do so he must join 
                a channel. Channels are created or joined by users issuing a command 
                to the IRC program to join a channel. If there is already a channel 
                of the specified name in operation, then the user is added to 
                the list of people communicating within that channel; if such 
                a channel does not exist, then IRC opens a new channel containing 
                the name of the user who invoked it, who may then be joined by 
                other users. The user can issue a commands requesting a list of 
                the users connected to IRC and which channels they are attached 
                to. IRC keeps track of who has joined which channels, and ensures 
                that only people within the same channel can see each others' 
                typed messages. IRC can support an unlimited number of channels. 
                Channels can have any name, but generally the name of the channel 
                indicates the nature of the conversation being carried out within 
                it - 'Finland', 'hottub', 'worker', 'party', and so on. The user 
                who initially invokes a channel name is known an a channel operator, 
                or 'chanop', and has certain privileges. He or she may change 
                the mode of the channel - may instruct IRC to limit usage of the 
                channel to a certain number of users, may limit entry to the channel 
                to people specifically invited by him or her to join, may make 
                the channel invisible to other users by specifying it's exclusion 
                from the list of active channels that a user may request of IRC, 
                may kick another user off the channel, or confer chanop privileges 
                on another user. 
              <p>IRC supports numerous other commands. Once a channel has been 
                joined, everything that the user types will be by default sent 
                to all other occupants of the channel. It is possible, however, 
                to alter that default setting by issuing commands to direct a 
                message to a particular user, users, channel or channels. A number 
                of other commands - the ability to send messages to all users 
                or to kick a user off the IRC system entirely - are reserved for 
                IRC operators, or 'opers', the people who run and maintain the 
                IRC network connections. Opers also have access to special commands 
                related to the technical implementation of IRC. 
              <p>IRC is not an 'official' program. There are few 'official' programs 
                on the Internet. Most are simply programs that a group of people, 
                who by virtue of their paid or student work have access to computers 
                on the Internet, have decided to install on these machines. IRC 
                operators are people who have chosen to invest the time needed 
                to set up and maintain the IRC program on their local machines 
                for the benefit of other local users. 
              <p>IRC, then, is a multi-user synchronous communications system. 
                It allows people to choose which person or group of people they 
                wish to see the activity of, and to whom they wish their own activity 
                to be transmitted.<a 
href="http://www.crosswinds.net/~aluluei/electropolis.htm#note21">(21)</a> IRC 
                - the whole Internet - forms a 'virtual reality'.<a 
href="http://www.crosswinds.net/~aluluei/electropolis.htm#note22">(22)</a> In 
                the words of John Perry Barlow: 
              <p> 
              <blockquote>Whether by one telephonic tendril or millions, [these 
                computers are all] connected to one another. Collectively, they 
                form what their inhabitants call the Net. It extends across that 
                immense region of electron states, microwaves, magnetic fields, 
                light pulses and thought which sci-fi writer William Gibson named 
                Cyberspace. Cyberspace, in its present condition, has a lot in 
                common with the 19th Century West. It is vast, unmapped, culturally 
                and legally ambiguous, verbally terse (unless you happen to be 
                a court stenographer), hard to get around in, and up for grabs... 
                In this silent world, all conversation is typed. To enter it, 
                one forsakes both body and place and becomes a thing of words 
                alone... It is, of course, a perfect breeding ground for both 
                outlaws and new ideas...<a 
  href="http://www.crosswinds.net/~aluluei/electropolis.htm#note23">(23)</a> </blockquote>
              <p>Within this breeding ground, users of IRC invent new concepts 
                of culture and interaction, and challenge the conventions of both.

                Deconstructing Boundaries</a></h1>
              Traditional forms of human interaction have their codes of etiquette. 
              We are all brought up to behave according to the demands of social 
              context. We know, as if instinctively, when it is appropriate to 
              flirt, to be respectful, to be angry, or silent. The information 
              on which we decide which aspects of our systems of social conduct 
              are appropriate to our circumstances are more often physical than 
              verbal. Place and time are perceptions of a physical reality that 
              are not dependent on statements made by other people. We do not 
              need to be told that we are at a wedding, and should be quiet during 
              the ceremony, in order to enact the code of etiquette that our culture 
              reserves for such occasions. "Being cultured" says Greg Dening, 
              "we are experts in our semiotics... we read sign and symbol [and] 
              codify a thousand words in a gesture."<a 
href="http://www.crosswinds.net/~aluluei/electropolis.htm#note24">(24)</a> In 
              interacting with other people, we rely on non-verbal information 
              to delineate a context for our own contributions. Smiles, frowns, 
              tones of voice, posture and dress - Geertz's "significant symbols" 
              - tell us more about the social context within which we are placed 
              than do the statements of the people we socialise with.<a 
href="http://www.crosswinds.net/~aluluei/electropolis.htm#note25">(25)</a> Language 
              does not express the full play of our interpersonal exchanges - 
              which, continues Dening, "are expressed in terms of address, in 
              types of clothing, in postures and facial expressions, in appeals 
              to rules and ways of doing things."<a 
href="http://www.crosswinds.net/~aluluei/electropolis.htm#note26">(26)</a> The 
              words themselves tell only half the story - it is their presentation 
              that completes the picture. 
              <p>Internet Relay Chat, however, deals only in words. Computer- 
                mediated communication relies only upon words as a channel of 
                meaning.<a 
href="http://www.crosswinds.net/~aluluei/electropolis.htm#note27">(27)</a> "Computer-mediated 
                communication has at least two interesting characteristics:" writes 
                Kiesler, "(a) a paucity of social context information and (b) 
                few widely shared norms governing its use."<a 
href="http://www.crosswinds.net/~aluluei/electropolis.htm#note28">(28)</a> Users 
                of these systems are unable to rely on the conventions of gesture 
                and nuances of tone to provide social feedback. They cannot rely 
                upon the conventional systems of interaction if they are to make 
                sense to one another. Words, as we use them in speech, fail to 
                express what they really mean once they are deprived of the subtleties 
                of speech and the non- verbal cues that we assume will accompany 
                it. Internet Relay Chat is synchronous, as is face-to-face interaction, 
                but it is unable to transmit the non-verbal aspects of speech 
                that conventions of synchronous communication demand. It is not 
                only the meanings of sentences that become problematic in computer-mediated 
                communication. The standards of behaviour that are normally decided 
                upon by non-verbal cues are not clearly indicated when information 
                is purely textual. Not only are smiles and frowns lost in the 
                translation of synchronous speech to pure text, but factors of 
                environment are unknown to interlocutors. It is not immediately 
                apparent, in computer-mediated communication, what forms of social 
                etiquette are appropriate at any given time. 
              <p>Kiesler, Siegel and McGuire have described computer-mediated 
                communication as having four distinct features in comparison to 
                conventional forms of interaction: an absence of regulating feedback, 
                dramaturgical weakness, few social status cues and social anonymity. 
                Conventional systems for regulating interaction fall apart. The 
                structure of IRC causes its users to deconstruct the conventional 
                boundaries defining social interaction. "Anonymity [and] reduced 
                self-regulation" become, as I shall discuss, pronounced in computer-mediated 
                communication.<a

              <p> 
              <h2>Anonymity</h2>
              Although the social and economic status generally associated with 
              the use of such high technology as computer systems offers IRC users, 
              as I have indicated, some general context within which to place 
              each other, they know little else about each other, and that little 
              is open to manipulation by the user. 
              <p>Users of Internet Relay Chat are not generally known by their 
                'real' names. The convention of IRC is to choose a nickname under 
                which to interact.<a 
href="http://www.crosswinds.net/~aluluei/electropolis.htm#note30">(30)</a> The 
                nicknames - or 'nicks' as they are referred to - chosen by IRC 
                users range from 'normal' first names such as 'Peggy' and 'Matthew', 
                to inventive and evocative pseudonyms such as 'Tmbrwolf', 'Pplater', 
                'LuxYacht' and 'WildWoman'.<a 
href="http://www.crosswinds.net/~aluluei/electropolis.htm#note31">(31)</a> The 
                information which one user can gain about others on IRC consists 
                of the names by which they choose to be known and the Internet 
                'address' of the computer by which they are accessing the IRC 
                program. The first is easily changed. IRC supports a command that 
                allows users to change their nicknames as often as they wish. 
                The second is not so easily manipulated, but still open to tampering 
                provided that the user has some technical skill. Essentially there 
                is nothing that one IRC user can ascertain about another - beyond 
                the fact that they have access to the Internet - that is not manipulable 
                by that user. 
              <p>Our conventional presentation of self assumes that we cannot 
                change the basics of our appearance. Physical characteristics, 
                although open to cosmetic or fashionable manipulation, are basically 
                unalterable. What we look like, we have to live with. This is, 
                however, not the case on IRC. How an IRC user 'looks' to another 
                user is entirely dependant upon information supplied by that person. 
                It becomes possible to play with identity. The boundaries delineated 
                by cultural constructs of beauty, ugliness, fashionableness or 
                unfashionableness, can be by-passed on IRC. It is possible to 
                appear to be, quite literally, whoever you wish. 
              <p>The anonymity of interaction in IRC allows users to play games 
                with their identities. The chance to escape the assumed boundaries 
                of gender, race, and age create a game of interaction in which 
                there are few rules but those that the users create themselves. 
                IRC offers a chance to escape the language of culture and body 
                and return to an idealised 'source code' of mind. 
              <p>The changes that a user might make to his or her perceived identity 
                can be small, a matter of realising in others' minds a desire 
                to be attractive, impressive, popular: 
              <p> 
              <pre>    *BabyDoll* Well, I gotta admit, I shave a few lbs off of my
     wieght when I tell the guys on irc what i look like..
</pre>
              <p>However, the anonymity of IRC can provide more than a means to 
                'fix' minor problems of appearance - one of the most fascinating 
                aspects of this computer-mediated fluidity of cultural boundaries 
                is the possibility of gender-switching. While secondary characteristics 
                such as hair colour are relatively easily changed in 'real life', 
                gender reassignment is a far more involved process. This aspect 
                of computer-mediated communication has had little attention given 
                it. Sproull and Kiesler note that "unless first names are used 
                as well as last names, gender information is also missing", but 
                do not discuss the implications of this.<a 
href="http://www.crosswinds.net/~aluluei/electropolis.htm#note32">(32)</a> IRC 
                destroys the usually all but insurmountable confines of sex: changing 
                gender is as simple as changing one's nickname to something that 
                suggests the opposite of one's actual gender. It is possible for 
                IRC to become the arena for experimentation with gender specific 
                social roles: 
              <p> 
              <pre>     &lt;Marion&gt; I've tried presenting m,yslef as male on occasion -
     to be honest I found itdull
     &lt;Barf&gt; Umm, I've gender switched once or twice for about 2 
     hour or so - mainly to lead another male up the garden path 
     as a practical joke; but never a serious gender switch.
     &lt;Marion&gt; how did you find being perceived as female?
     &lt;Barf&gt; I wasn't really being perceived as female, since I 
     was basically just calling myself by a female name and 
     utilising my knowledge of being male to get the other male 
     all stirred up
     &lt;Barf&gt; I did find it mildly irritating that I should get so 
     much attention and be immediately fixated as a sex object 
     simply by pretending to be female 
     &lt;Marion&gt; to be honest, I didn't like being male becuaseI 
     missed the flattery that women tend to get 
     &lt;Marion&gt; being expected to give attention ratehr than 
     recieve it was quite a shock!
     &lt;Barf&gt; ahh - that is one reason that I tend to dislike 
     unequal ratios in the sexes - the females get all the 
     attention.<a href="http://www.crosswinds.net/~aluluei/electropolis.htm#note33">(33)</a>
</pre>
              <p>The potential for such experimentation governs the expectations 
                of many users of IRC. Gender is one of the more 'sacred' institutions 
                in our society, a quality whose fixity is so assumed that enacted 
                or surgical reassignment has and does involve complex rituals, 
                taboos, procedures and stigmas. The attitudes taken by individual 
                users of IRC differ as regards the possibility for gender concealment. 
                Some view it as 'part of the game', others are hostile toward 
                users who gender switch: 
              <p> 
              <pre>     &lt;saro&gt; KAREN IS A BOY
     &lt;saro&gt; KAREN IS A BOY
     &lt;saro&gt; KAREN IS A BOY
     &lt;SmilyFace&gt; aros: so?????????
     &lt;Karen&gt; yes aros I heard you 
     &lt;FuzzyB&gt; Takes a relaxed place beside Karen offering her  
     her favourite drink.
</pre>
              <p>Whatever may be the attitude of individual users of the IRC program 
                to such examples of gender experimentation, the crucial point 
                is that it is an inherent possibility offered by the IRC software. 
                Exploitation of this potential is an accepted part of the 'virtual 
                reality' - a popular phrase amongst users of the Internet - of 
                IRC. It becomes possible to play with aspects of behaviour and 
                identity that are not normally possible. IRC enables people to 
                deconstruct aspects of their own identity, and of their cultural 
                classification, and to challenge and obscure the boundaries between 
                some of our most deeply felt cultural significances. A willingness 
                to accept this phenomenon, and to join in the games that can be 
                played within it, is an aspect of the culture of IRC users.

              <h2>Reduced Self-Regulation</h2>
              Researchers of human behaviour on computer-mediated communication 
              systems have often noted that users of such systems tend to behave 
              in a more uninhibited manner than they would in face-to- face encounters. 
              Sproull and Kiesler state that computer-mediated behaviour "is relatively 
              uninhibited and nonconforming."<a 
href="http://www.crosswinds.net/~aluluei/electropolis.htm#note34">(34)</a> Kielser, 
              Siegel and McGuire have observed that "people in computer-mediated 
              groups were more uninhibited than they were in face-to-face groups."<a 
href="http://www.crosswinds.net/~aluluei/electropolis.htm#note35">(35)</a> Rice 
              and Love suggest that "disinhibition" may occur "because of the 
              lack of social control that nonverbal cues provide."<a 
href="http://www.crosswinds.net/~aluluei/electropolis.htm#note36">(36)</a> 
              <p>Internet Relay Chat reflects this observation. Protected by the 
                anonymity of the computer medium, and with few social context 
                cues to indicate 'proper' ways to behave, users are able to express 
                and experiment with aspects of their personality that social inhibition 
                would generally encourage them to suppress: 
              <p> 
              <pre>     &lt;Barf&gt; Yes.. Oh well - I'm just saying that I switch
     personalities all the time, and my usual personality on IRC 
     and my usual personality on Fidonet are at extremes, and 
     I've never really shown my real self on any computer medium.
     &lt;Barf&gt; I'm deliberately creating fake personalities instead 
     of highlighting less obvious parts of my personality, so I 
     do the opposite of what my real self would do.
     &lt;Marion&gt; by doing something it by definition becomes an 
     aspect of yourself - what you call your 'real self' is most 
     likely the way you would like to see yourself or the way you 
     usually are 
     &lt;Barf&gt; I'm experiment in being different people, and that
     involves doing things that I don't want to do to make the 
     fake character consistent and believable
     &lt;Barf&gt; No - my fake characters often do things and behave in
     such a way that I wouldn't want to ever be like
     &lt;Marion&gt; woulsn't want to - perhaps not - but if it occurs 
     to you to encat it then it is part of your potentiality 
     &lt;Barf&gt; Ah - but the reason that I experiment with different
     characters is so I can see how other people react and then 
     adopt the good parts of the character that provoked a 
     favourable response - however I don't compromise my own 
     individuality and will continue  
     &lt;Barf&gt; to do things that I like to do that not everyone else
     would like me to do.<a href="http://www.crosswinds.net/~aluluei/electropolis.htm#note37">(37)</a>
</pre>
              <p>IRC encourages disinhibition. The lack of social context cues 
                in computer-mediated communication obscures the boundaries that 
                would generally separate acceptable and unacceptable forms of 
                behaviour. Furthermore, the essential physical impression of each 
                user that he is alone releases him from the social expectations 
                incurred in group interaction. Computer-mediated communication 
                is less bound by conventions than is face-to-face interaction. 
                With little regulating feedback to govern behaviour, users behave 
                in ways that would not generally be acceptable with people who 
                are essentially total strangers. 
              <p>The lack of self-regulation amongst users of IRC can be both 
                positive and negative, as far as interaction is concerned. The 
                safety of anonymity can "reduce self-consciousness and promote 
                intimacy" between people who might not otherwise have had the 
                chance to become close.<a 
href="http://www.crosswinds.net/~aluluei/electropolis.htm#note38">(38)</a> It 
                can also encourage "flaming", which Kiesler, Siegel and McGuire 
                define as the gratuitous and uninhibited making of "remarks containing 
                swearing, insults, name calling, and hostile comments."<a 
href="http://www.crosswinds.net/~aluluei/electropolis.htm#note39">(39)</a> 
              <p>Users of IRC often form strong friendships. Without social context 
                cues to inhibit a free exchange between people - to encourage 
                shyness - computer-mediated interlocutors will often 'open up' 
                to each other to a great degree. Freedom is given, either to be 
                someone whom you are not, or to be more yourself than would usually 
                be acceptable. As one user of the system sums it up: 
              <p> 
              <pre>     *bob* by nature I'm shy..
     *bob* normally wouldn't talk about such thingsw if you met 
     me face to face
     *bob* thus the network is good..  <a href="http://www.crosswinds.net/~aluluei/electropolis.htm#note40">(40)</a>
</pre>
              <p>Personal relationships amongst participants in computer-mediated 
                communication systems can often be deep and highly emotional. 
                Hiltz and Turoff have noted that some participants in such systems 
                "come to feel that their very best and closest friends are members 
                of their electronic group, whom they seldom or never see."<a 
href="http://www.crosswinds.net/~aluluei/electropolis.htm#note41">(41)</a> 'Net.romances', 
                long distance romantic relationships carried out over IRC, can 
                result from the increased tendency for participants in CMC systems 
                to be uninhibited:<a 
href="http://www.crosswinds.net/~aluluei/electropolis.htm#note42">(42)</a> 
              <p> 
              <pre>     Channel    Nickname  S   User@Host (Name)

     +custard   Daniel	  H@  *@*.*.*.edu.au (Daniel - Lori's
     beloved)...
     &lt;Lori&gt; After just a few chats on irc, it became obvious to 
     me that this was someone I could easily become very good 
     friends  with him...
     &lt;Lori&gt; The more we talked, the more we discovered we had in
     common...
     &lt;Lori&gt; By this time, I knew I was starting to have "more 
     than just a friend" feelings about Daniel...
     &lt;Lori&gt; I told him that I was starting to get a crush on 
     him...
     &lt;Lori&gt; Anyway, it's grown and grown over the months.
     &lt;Daniel&gt; A few mishaps, but we've overcome them, to bounce 
     back stronger than ever.
     &lt;Lori&gt; And, as you know, we'll be getting together for 3 
     weeks at the end of November, to see if we're as wonderful 
     as we think we are.
</pre>
              <p>Such expressions of feeling are not in any way thought to be 
                shallow or ephemeral. Far from being unsatisfactory for "more 
                interpersonally involving communication tasks, such as getting 
                to know someone", as Hiemstra describes researchers of CMC behaviour 
                as having characterised the medium, IRC has in this instance fostered 
                an extremely emotional bond between two people.<a 
href="http://www.crosswinds.net/~aluluei/electropolis.htm#note43">(43)</a> Users 
                of IRC are able to so dispense with the conventional boundaries 
                surrounding communication, and cross-cultural exchange, to form 
                deep friendships, even love-affairs, with people whom they have 
                never met. 
              <p>Net.romances display computer-mediated relationships at their 
                most idyllic. However, disinhibition and increased freedom from 
                social norms have another side. Along with increased broad- mindedness 
                and intimacy among some users goes increased hostility on the 
                part of others. 'Flaming', the expression of anger, insults and 
                hatred, is a common phenomenon in all forms of computer-mediated 
                communication, and IRC is no exception. Anonymity makes the possibility 
                of social punishment for transgression of cultural mores appear 
                to be limited. Attracting the anger of other users of the system 
                is a relatively unthreatening prospect - although it is possible 
                for users to ignore a particular user, all that user need do is 
                change his or her nickname to 'start afresh' with the people whom 
                he or she had alienated. Protected by terminals and separated 
                by distance, the sanction of physical violence is irrelevant, 
                although, as I shall discuss later, social sanctions are present 
                and often in a textual form that apes physical violence. The safety 
                of anonymous expression of hostilities and obscenities that would 
                otherwise incur social sanctions, encourages some people to use 
                IRC as a forum for airing their resentment of individuals or groups 
                in a blatantly uninhibited manner: 
              <p> 
              <pre>     !Venice! Bashers have taken over +gblf... we could use some

</pre>
              <p>Not all uninhibited behaviour on IRC is either so negative or 
                so positive. Much of the opportunity for uninhibited behaviour 
                is invested by users of IRC in sexual experimentation. The usually 
                culturally-enforced boundaries between sexual and platonic relationships 
                are challenged in computer-mediated circumstances. Norms of etiquette 
                are obscured by the lack of social context cues, and the safety 
                given by anonymity and distance allow users to ignore otherwise 
                strict codes regarding sexual behaviour. Conversations on IRC 
                can be sexually explicit, in blatant disregard for social norms 
                regarding the propositioning of strangers: 
              <p> 
              <pre>     *Han* does this compu-sex stuff really happen?
     Lola-&gt; *Han* *smooch*

     *Han* me tooo.....are oyu horny today at all ; )?

     *Han* mmmmmm......when did you last get off?<a href="http://www.crosswinds.net/~aluluei/electropolis.htm#note45">(45)</a>
</pre>
              <p>Such behaviour is often referred to as 'net.sleazing'. Perhaps 
                because the majority of the users of IRC are in their late teens 
                or early twenties, since the Internet primarily serves educational 
                institutions and thus students, sexual experimentation is a popular 
                Internet game. Adolescents, coming to terms with their sexuality 
                in the 'real world', find that the freedom of 'virtual reality' 
                allows them to safely engage in sexual experimentation. Ranging 
                from the afore-mentioned gender- role switching to flirtation 
                and 'compu-sex', IRC provides a medium for the safe expression 
                of a "steady barrage of typed testosterone."<a 
href="http://www.crosswinds.net/~aluluei/electropolis.htm#note46">(46)</a> 
              <p>Disinhibition and the lack of sanctions encouraging self- regulation 
                lead to extremes of behaviour on IRC. Users express hate, love, 
                intimacy and anger, employing the freedom of the electronic medium 
                to air views and engage in relationships that would in other circumstances 
                be deemed unacceptable in relating to strangers. This 'freedom' 
                does not imply that IRC is an idyllic environment. Play with social 
                conventions can indeed lead to greater positive affect between 
                people, as it has between 'Daniel' and 'Lori', and to greater 
                personal fulfilment for some users. It can, however, also create 
                a violent chaos in which people feel 'free' to act upon prejudices, 
                even hatreds, that might otherwise be socially controlled. 
              <p> 
              <h2>Beyond Boundaries</h2>
              Users of IRC treat the medium as a frontier world, a virtual reality 
              of virtual freedom, in which participants feel free to act out their 
              fantasies, to challenge social norms, and exercise aspects of their 
              personality that would under normal interactive circumstances be 
              inhibited. The medium itself blocks some of the socially inhibiting 
              institutions that users would, under other circumstances, be operating 
              within. Social indicators - of social position, of age and authority, 
              of personal appearance - are relatively weak in a computer-mediated 
              context. They might be inferred, but they are not evident. Internet 
              Relay Chat leaves it open to users to create virtual replacements 
              for these social cues - as I shall discuss later, IRC interaction 
              involves the creation of replacements and substitutes for physical 
              cues, and the construction of social hierarchies and positions of 
              authority. That it is possible for users of IRC to do this is due 
              to the ways in which the medium deconstructs conventional boundaries 
              constraining interaction and conventional institutions of interpersonal 
              relationships. It is this freedom from convention that allows IRC 
              users to create their own conventions, and to become a cohesive 
              community. 
              <p>The chance for deconstruction of social boundaries that is offered 
                by IRC is essentially postmodern. On its lighter side, computer-mediated 
                communication lends itself to irony, pastiche, playfulness and 
                a celebration of ephemeral and essentially superficial examples 
                of witty bravado. On its more negative side, the disinhibiting 
                effect of computer-mediated communication encourages the expression 
                of dissent, rebellion, hostility, and anti-social chaos. It involves 
                a stripping away of the social coordinates that let the user know 
                where he or she is in the cultural network, indeed it encourages 
                this by allowing the continual invention of new moves to old language 
                games.<a 
href="http://www.crosswinds.net/~aluluei/electropolis.htm#note47">(47)</a> 
              <p>Users challenge the boundaries between their differing social 
                systems, introducing elements of intimacy to meetings with strangers 
                and foreigners, overstepping the thresholds of social nicety. 
                There is a continual search for ways to present the unpresentable, 
                to bring elements technically outside the medium of communication 
                within its realm. Whether this continual play with the limits 
                of expression is positive or negative, it involves users of the 
                system in a game that is essentially postmodern. Engagement with 
                the system involves immersion in the specific context of the IRC 
                program. There is no way to interact with IRC without being a 
                part of it - it is interaction that creates the virtual reality 
                of channels and spaces for communication. Immersed in this specific, 
                although not 'local' in any geographic sense, context, players 
                of the IRC game are involved in turning upside down the taken-for-granted 
                norms of the external culture. Emotions and behaviours are taken 
                out of their usual contexts and transposed into the electronic 
                context of IRC, where they cease to be unproblematic. Faced with 
                the impossibility of replicating conventional social boundaries 
                in the IRC environment, users of the system search out and experiment 
                with new and unconventional ways of relating. It is this "symbolic 
                cultural ethos... that reflects the postmodern elements of the 
                computer underground and separates it from modernism... by offering 
                an ironic response to the primacy of a master technocratic language."<a 
href="http://www.crosswinds.net/~aluluei/electropolis.htm#note48">(48)</a> The 
                users of IRC have created a culture that challenges "the sanctity 
                of an established... authority."<a 
href="http://www.crosswinds.net/~aluluei/electropolis.htm#note49">(49)</a> To 
                paraphrase Jim Thomas and Gordon Meyer, speaking on the computer 
                underground of 'hackers', it is this style of playful rebellion, 
                irreverent subversion and juxtaposition of fantasy with high-tech 
                reality that impels me to interpret IRC as a postmodernist culture.<a

              <blockquote>In crude relief, culture can be understood as a set 
                of solutions devised by a group of people to meet specific problems 
                posed by situations they face in common... This notion of culture 
                as a living, historical product of group problem solving allows 
                an approach to cultural study that is applicable to any group, 
                be it a society, a neighbourhood, a family, a dance band, or an 
                organization and its segments.<a 
  href="http://www.crosswinds.net/~aluluei/electropolis.htm#note51">(51)</a> </blockquote>
              This definition of culture owes much to Geertz's understanding of 
              culture as a "system of meanings that give significance to shared 
              behaviours which must be interpreted from the perspective of hose 
              engaged in them."<a 
href="http://www.crosswinds.net/~aluluei/electropolis.htm#note52">(52)</a> 'Culture' 
              includes not only the systems and standards adopted by a group for 
              "perceiving, believing, evaluating and acting", but also includes 
              the "rules and symbols of interpretation and discourse" utilised 
              by the members of the group.<a 
href="http://www.crosswinds.net/~aluluei/electropolis.htm#note53">(53)</a> Culture, 
              says Geertz, is "a set of control mechanisms - plans, recipes, rules, 
              instructions (what computer engineers call 'programs') - for the 
              governing of behaviour."<a 
href="http://www.crosswinds.net/~aluluei/electropolis.htm#note54">(54)</a> In 
              this sense the users of IRC constitute a culture, a community. They 
              are commonly faced with the problems posed by the medium's inherent 
              deconstruction of traditional models of social interaction which 
              are based on physical proximity. 
              <p>The measures which users of the IRC system have devised to meet 
                their common problems, posed by the medium's lack of regulating 
                feedback and social context cues, its dramaturgical weakness, 
                and the factor of anonymity, are the markers of their community, 
                their common culture. These measures fall into two distinct categories. 
                Firstly, users of IRC have devised systems of symbolism and textual 
                significance to ensure that they achieve understanding despite 
                the lack of more usual channels of communication. Secondly, a 
                variety of social sanctions have arisen amongst the IRC community 
                in order to punish users who disobey the rules of etiquette - 
                or 'netiquette' - and the integrity of those shared systems of 
                the interpretation.<a

              <p> 
              <h2>Shared Significances</h2>
              In traditional forms of communication, as I have already suggested, 
              nods, smiles, eye contact, distance, tone of voice and other non-verbal 
              behaviours give speakers and listeners information they can use 
              to regulate, modify and control communication. Separated by at least 
              the ethernet cables of local area networks, and quite likely by 
              thousands of kilometres, the users of IRC are unable to base interaction 
              on these phenomena. This "dramaturgical weakness of electronic media" 
              presents a unique problem.<a 
href="http://www.crosswinds.net/~aluluei/electropolis.htm#note56">(56)</a> Much 
              of our understandings of linguistic meaning and social context are 
              derived from non-verbal cues. With these unavailable, it remains 
              for users of computer-mediated communication to create methods of 
              compensating for the lack. As Hiltz and Turoff have reported, computer 
              conferees have developed ways of sending computerised screams, hugs 
              and kisses.<a 
href="http://www.crosswinds.net/~aluluei/electropolis.htm#note57">(57)</a> This 
              is apparent on IRC. 
              <p>Textual substitution for traditionally non-verbal information 
                is a highly stylized, even artistic, procedure that is central 
                to the construction of an IRC community. Common practice is to 
                simply verbalise physical cues, for instance literally typing 
                'hehehe' when traditional methods of communication would call 
                for laughter. IRC behaviour takes this to an extreme. It is a 
                recognised convention to describe physical actions or reactions, 
                denoted as such by presentation between two asterisks:<a 
href="http://www.crosswinds.net/~aluluei/electropolis.htm#note58">(58)</a> 
              <p> 
              <pre>     &lt;Wizard&gt; Come, brave Knight! Let me cast a spell of 
     protection on you..... Oooops - wrong spell! You don;t mind 
     being green for a while- do you???
     &lt;Prince&gt; Lioness: please don't eat him...
     &lt;storm&gt; *shivers from the looks of lioness*
     &lt;Knight&gt; Wizard: Not at all.
     &lt;Bel_letre&gt; *hahahah*
     &lt;Lioness&gt; Very well, your excellency.  *looks frustrated*
     &lt;Prince&gt; *falls down laughing*.
     &lt;Knight&gt; Wizard: as long as I can protect thou ass, I'd be 
     utter grateful! :-)
     &lt;Bel_letre&gt; *Plays a merry melody*
     &lt;storm&gt; *walks over to lioness and pats her paw*
     &lt;Wizard&gt; *Dispells the spells cast on Knight!*
     &lt;Wizard&gt; Knight: Your back to normal!!!
     &lt;Prince&gt; *brings a pallete of meat for Lioness*
     &lt;Lioness&gt; *licks Storm*
     &lt;storm&gt; *Looking up* Thank You for not eating me!<a href="http://www.crosswinds.net/~aluluei/electropolis.htm#note59">(59)</a>

              <p>The above extract from a log of an IRC session, involving an 
                online fantasy role-playing game, shows a concentration of verbalised 
                physical actions and reactions. This density of virtually physical 
                cues is somewhat abnormal, but it amply demonstrates the extent 
                to which users of the IRC system feel it important to create a 
                physical context within which their peers can interpret their 
                behaviour. Verbal statements by themselves give little indication 
                of the emotional state of the speaker, and without physical expression 
                to decode the specific context of statements, it is easy to misinterpret 
                their intent: 
              <p> 
              <pre>     *Whopper* just kidding...not trying to be offensive
     &lt;Fireship-&gt; *Whopper* didn't assume that you were...<a href="http://www.crosswinds.net/~aluluei/electropolis.htm#note60">(60)</a>
</pre>
              <p>The corollary of Geertz's definition of culture is that groups 
                of people who fail to communicate do not compose a common culture. 
                If meaning is lost in transition from speaker to addressee, then 
                community is lost - "undirected by culture patterns - organized 
                systems of significant symbols - man's behaviour would be virtually 
                ungovernable, a mere chaos of pointless acts and exploding emotions, 
                his experience virtually shapeless."<a 
href="http://www.crosswinds.net/~aluluei/electropolis.htm#note61">(61)</a> In 
                order for IRC users to constitute a community it is necessary 
                for them to contrive a method to circumvent the possibility of 
                loss of intended meaning of statements. Verbalisation of physical 
                condition is that method. Interlocutors will describe what their 
                reactions to specific statements would be were they in physical 
                contact. Of course, this stylized description of action is not 
                intended to be taken as a literal description of the speakers' 
                physical actions, which are, obviously, typing at a keyboard and 
                staring at a monitor. Rather they are meant to represent what 
                would be their actions were the virtual reality of IRC an actual 
                reality. Without some way of compensating for the inherent lack 
                of social context cues in computer-mediated communication, IRC 
                would get no further than the deconstruction of conventional social 
                boundaries. The textual cues utilised on IRC provide the symbols 
                of interpretation and discourse that the users of IRC have devised 
                to 'meet specific problems posed by situations they face in common.' 
                Without these textual cues to substitute for non-verbal language, 
                the users of IRC would fail to constitute a community - with them, 
                they do. 
              <p>The users of IRC often utilise a 'shorthand' for the description 
                of physical condition. They (in common with users of other computer-mediated 
                communication systems such as news and email) have developed a 
                system of presenting textual characters as representations of 
                physical action. Commonly known as 'smileys', CMC users employ 
                alphanumeric characters and punctuation symbols to create strings 
                of highly emotively charged keyboard art: 
              <p> 
              <pre>     :-) or : )      a smiling face, as viewed side-on
     ;-) or ; )      a winking, smiling face
     :-( or : (      an 'unsmiley': an unhappy face
     :-(*)           someone about to throw up
     8-)             someone whose eyes are opened wide in surprise.
     :-P             someone sticking out their tongue
     &gt;:-O            someone screaming in fright, their hair 
                     standing on end
     :-X             someone whose lips are sealed
     @}-`-,-`--      a rose
</pre>
              <p>These 'emoticons' are many and various.<a 
href="http://www.crosswinds.net/~aluluei/electropolis.htm#note62">(62)</a> Although 
                the most commonly used is the plain smiling face - used to denote 
                pleasure or amusement, or to soften a sarcastic comment - it is 
                common for IRC users to develop their own emoticons, adapting 
                the symbols available on the standard keyboard to create minute 
                and essentially ephemeral pieces of textual art to represent their 
                own virtual actions and responses. Such inventiveness and lateral 
                thinking demands skill. Successful communication within IRC depends 
                on the use of such conventions as verbalised action and the use 
                of emoticons. Personal success on IRC, then, depends on the user's 
                ability to manipulate these tools. The users who can succinctly 
                and graphically portray themselves to the rest of the IRC usership 
                will be most able to create a community within that virtual system. 
              <p>Speed of response and wit are the stuff of popularity and community 
                on IRC. The Internet relays chat, and such social endeavour demands 
                speed of thought - witty replies and keyboard savoir faire blend 
                into a stream-of-consciousness interaction that valorises shortness 
                of response time, ingenuity and ingenuousness in the presentation 
                of statements. The person who cannot fulfil these requirements 
                - who is a slow typist, who demands time to reflect before responding, 
                will be disadvantaged. For those who can keep the pace, such 'stream-of-consciousness' 
                communication encourages a degree of intimacy and emotion that 
                would be unusual between complete strangers in the 'real world'. 
                The IRC community relies on this intimacy, on spur of the moment 
                social overtures made to other users:

              <p>IRC users regard their electronic world with a great deal of 
                seriousness, and generally with a sense of responsibility for 
                their fellows. The degree of trust in the supportive nature of 
                the community that is shown in the above example, and the degree 
                to which that trust was justified, demonstrates this. Hiltz and 
                Turoff have described this syndrome of empathetic community arising 
                amongst groups of people participating in CMC systems. They have 
                "observed very overt attempts to be personal and friendly" and 
                note that "strong feelings of friendship" arise between computer-mediated 
                interlocutors who have never met face- to-face. IRC may encourage 
                participants to play with the conventions of social interaction, 
                but the games are not always funny. The threads holding IRC together 
                as a community are made up of shared modes of understanding, and 
                the concepts shared range from the light-hearted and fanciful 
                to the personal and anguished. The success of this is dependant 
                upon the degree to which users can trust that the issues that 
                they communicate will be well received - they depend on the integrity 
                of users. 
              <p>This expectation of personal integrity and sincerity is both 
                upheld by convention and enforced by structure. 
              <p> 
              <h2>Social Sanctions</h2>
              One of the most sensitive issues amongst users is the question of 
              nicknames. The IRC program demands that users offer a unique name 
              to the system, to be used in their interaction with other users. 
              These aliases are chosen as the primary method by which a user is 
              known to other users, and thus generally reflect some aspect of 
              the user's personality or interests. It is common for users to prefer 
              and consistently use one nickname. Members of the IRC community 
              have developed a service, known as 'Nickserv', which enables IRC 
              users to register nicknames as belonging to a specific user accessing 
              the IRC system from a specific computer on the Internet. Any other 
              user who chooses to use a nickname thus registered is sent a message 
              from Nickserv telling him or her that the chosen nickname is registered, 
              and advising them to choose an alternate name. Furthermore, the 
              IRC program will not allow two users to adopt the same nickname 
              simultaneously. The program design is so structured as to refuse 
              a user access to the system should he or she attempt to use the 
              nickname of another user who is online, regardless of whether their 
              nickname is registered. The user must choose a unique nickname before 
              being able to interact within IRC. Names, then, as the primary personal 
              interface on IRC, are of great importance. One of the greatest taboos, 
              one that is upheld by the basic software design, is the use of another's 
              chosen nickname. 
              <p>The illegitimate use of nicknames can cause anger on the part 
                of their rightful users and sometimes deep feelings of guilt on 
                the part of the perpetrators. This public announcement was made 
                by a male IRC user to the newsgroup alt.irc, a forum for asynchronous 
                discussion of IRC:<a

              <p> 
              <pre>        I admit to having used the nickname "allison" on several
     occasions,the name of an acquaintance and "virtual" friend 
     at another university.Under this nick, I talked on channels 
     +hottub and +gblf, as well as witha few individuals 
     privately.  This was a deceptive, immature thing to do,and I 
     am both embarrassed and ashamed of myself.<a href="http://www.crosswinds.net/~aluluei/electropolis.htm#note65">(65)</a>  I wish to 
     apologizeto everyone I misled, particularly users 'badping' 
     and 'kired'... I am truly sorry for what I have done, and 
     regret ever having usedIRC, though I think it has the 
     potential to be a wonderful forum and meansof communication.  
     It certainly makes the world seem a small place.I shall 
     never invade IRC with a false nick or username again.<a href="http://www.crosswinds.net/~aluluei/electropolis.htm#note66">(66)</a>
</pre>
              <p>The physical aspect of IRC may be only virtual, but the emotional 
                aspect is actual. IRC is not a 'game' in any light-hearted sense 
                - it can inspire deep feelings of guilt and responsibility. It 
                is also clear that users' acceptance of IRC's potential for the 
                deconstruction of social boundaries is limited by their reliance 
                on the construction of communities. Experimentation ceases to 
                be acceptable when it threatens the delicate balance of trust 
                that holds IRC together. The uniqueness of names, their consistent 
                use, and respect for - and expectation of - their integrity, is 
                crucial to the development of online communities. As previously 
                noted, should a user find him or herself unwelcome in a particular 
                channel all he or she need do is adopt another nickname to be 
                unrecognizable. The idea of community, however, does demand that 
                members be recognizable to each other. Were they not so, it would 
                be impossible for a coherent community to emerge. 
              <p>The sanctions available to the IRC community for use against 
                errant members are both social and structural. The degree to which 
                members feel, as 'Allison' did, a sense of shame for actions which 
                abuse the systems of meaning devised by the IRC community, is 
                related to the degree to which they participate in the deconstruction 
                of traditional social conventions. By being uninhibited, by experimenting 
                with cultural norms of gender and reciprocity in relationships, 
                'Allison' became a part of a social network that encourages self-exposure 
                by simulating anonymity and therefore invulnerability. In this 
                case, the systems of meaning created by the users of IRC have 
                become conventions with a terrorizing authority over those who 
                participate in their use. As I shall describe, users of IRC who 
                flout the conventions of the medium are ostracised, banished from 
                the community. The way to redemption for such erring members is 
                through a process of guilt and redemption; through, in 'Allison's' 
                case, a 'public' ritual of self-accusation, confession, repentance 
                and atonement. 
              <p>IRC supports mechanisms for the enforcement of acceptable behaviour 
                on IRC. Channel operators - 'chanops' or 'chops' - have access 
                to the /kick command, which throws a specified user out of the 
                given channel. IRC operators - 'opers' - have the ability to 'kill' 
                users, to break the network link that connects them to IRC. The 
                code of etiquette for doing so is outlined in the documentation 
                that is part of the IRC program: 
              <p> 
              <pre>     Obnoxious users had best beware the operator who's fast on 
     the /kill command. "/kill nickname" blows any given nickname
     completely out of the chat system. Obnoxiousness is not to 
     be tolerated. But operators do not use /kill lightly.<a href="http://www.crosswinds.net/~aluluei/electropolis.htm#note67">(67)</a> 
</pre>
              <p>There is a curious paradox in the concomitant usage of the words 
                'obnoxious' and 'kill'. Obnoxiousness seems a somewhat trivial 
                term to warrant the use of such textually violent commands such 
                as /kick and /kill. The word trivialises the degree to which abusive 
                behaviour, deceit, and shame can play a part in interaction on 
                Internet Relay Chat. The existence of such negative behaviour 
                and emotions is played down, denigrated - what is stressed is 
                the measures that can be taken by the 'authorities' - the chanops 
                and opers - on IRC. Violators of the integrity of the IRC system 
                are marginalised, outcast, described so as to seem insignificant, 
                but their potential for disrupting the IRC community is suggested 
                by the emotive strength of the words with which they are punished. 
                The terms 'killing' and 'kicking' substitute for their physical 
                counterparts - IRC users may be safe from physical threat, but 
                the community sanctions of violence and restraint are there, albeit 
                in textualised form. 
              <p>Operators have adopted their own code of etiquette regarding 
                /kills. It is the general rule that an operator issuing such a 
                command should let other operators, and the victim, know the reason 
                for his or her action by adding a comment to the '/kill message' 
                that fellow operators will receive: 
              <p> 
              <pre>     *** Notice -- Received KILL message for I4982784 from MaryD
     (Obscene Dumps!!!)
     *** Notice -- Received KILL message for mic from mgp  
     (massive abusive channel dumping involving lots of ctrl-gs 
     and gaybashing, amongst other almost as obnoxious stuff)
     *** Notice -- Received KILL message for JP from Cyberman
     ((repeatedely ignorning warnings to stop nickname 
     abuse))<a href="http://www.crosswinds.net/~aluluei/electropolis.htm#note68">(68)</a>
</pre>
              <p>There is no technical reason why such comments or excuses should 
                be given - they are purely a 'courtesy'. Those in authority on 
                IRC have self-imposed codes of behaviour which supposedly serve 
                to ensure that operator privileges are not abused. 
              <p>Operators have considerable power within IRC. They can control 
                not only an individual's access to IRC, but are also responsible 
                for maintaining the network connections that enable IRC programs 
                at widely geographically separated sites to 'see' each other. 
                The issue of whether or not operators have too much power is a 
                contentious one. While operators are careful to present their 
                /killings as justifiable in the eyes of their peers, this is often 
                not felt to be the case by their victims. Accusations of prejudice 
                and injustice abound. IRC operators answer user's complaints and 
                charges with self-justifications - often the debates are reduced 
                to 'flame-wars', abusive arguments between opponents who are more 
                concerned to insult and defeat rather than reason with each other: 
              <p> 
              <pre>     !JP! fucking stupid op cybman /killd me - think ya some kind 
     of net.god? WHy not _ask_ people in the channle i'm in if

</pre>
              <p>'Kills' can also be seen as unjustified by other operators, and 
                the operator whose actions are questioned by his peers is likely 
                to be 'killed' himself: 
              <p> 
              <pre>     *** Notice -- Received KILL message for Alfred from Kamikaze

     *** Notice -- Received KILL message for Kamikaze from dave 
     (yes, but they are allowed.)<a href="http://www.crosswinds.net/~aluluei/electropolis.htm#note70">(70)</a>
</pre>
              <p>The potential for tension between operators of IRC is often diffused 
                into a game. 'Killwars', episodes in which opers will kill each 
                other, often happen. There is rarely overt hostility in these 
                'wars' - the attitude taken is one of ironic realisation of the 
                responsibilities and powers that opers have, mixed with bravado 
                and humour - an effort to parody those same powers and responsibilities: 
              <p>

</pre>
              <p>The ideas of authority and freedom are often in opposition on 
                IRC, as the newly invented social conventions of the IRC community 
                attempt to deal with emotions and actions in ways that emulate 
                the often violent social sanctions of the 'real world.' The potential 
                for tension and hostility between users and opers arising over 
                the latter's use of power can erupt into anger and abuse. Disagreement 
                between operators over their implementation of power can result 
                in the use of operators' powers against each other. The games 
                that opers play with 'killing' express their realisation of the 
                existence of these elements in the hierarchical nature of IRC 
                culture and serve to diffuse that tension - at least among opers 
                - and to unite them as an authoritative class. But it does not 
                fully resolve these conflicts - the tensions that are expressed 
                regarding the oper/user power segregation system point to the 
                nexus point between the deconstruction of boundaries and the construction 
                of communities on IRC. 
              <p> 
              <h2>The IRC Community</h2>
              The emergent culture of IRC is essentially heterogeneous. Users 
              access the system from all over the world, and - within the constraints 
              of language compatibility - interact with people from cultures that 
              they might not have the chance to learn about through any other 
              direct means. The melting pot of the IRC 'electropolis', as Hiltz 
              and Turoff term computer-mediated communication networks, serves 
              to break down, yet valorise, the differences between cultures.<a 
href="http://www.crosswinds.net/~aluluei/electropolis.htm#note72">(72)</a> It 
              is not uncommon for IRC channels to contain no two people from the 
              same country. With the encouragement of intimacy between users and 
              the tendency for conventional social mores to be ignored on IRC, 
              it becomes possible for people to investigate the differences between 
              their cultures. No matter on how superficial a level that might 
              be, the encouragement of what can only be called friendship between 
              people of disparate cultural backgrounds helps to destroy any sense 
              of intolerance that each may have for the other's culture and to 
              foster a sense of cross-cultural community:<a

              <p>Irreverent, and ironic, this kind of exchange exhibits the cosmopolitan 
                nature of IRC. Cultural differences are celebrated, are made the 
                object of curiosity and excitement, while the interlocutors remain 
                aware of the relativity of their remarks. The ability to appreciate 
                cultural differences and to welcome immersion in them, while retaining 
                a sense of ironic distance from both that visited culture and 
                one's native culture, is the object of interest. 
              <p>Community on IRC is "created through symbolic strategies and 
                collective beliefs."<a 
href="http://www.crosswinds.net/~aluluei/electropolis.htm#note75">(75)</a> IRC 
                users share a common language, a shared web of verbal and textual 
                significances that are substitutes for, and yet distinct from, 
                the shared networks of meaning of the wider community. Users of 
                IRC share a vocabulary and a system of understanding that is unique 
                and therefore defines them as constituting a distinct culture. 
                This community is self-regulating, having systems of hierarchy 
                and power that allow for the punishment of transgressors of those 
                systems of behaviour and meaning. Members of the community feel 
                a sense of responsibility for IRC - most respect the conventions 
                of their subculture, and those who don't are either marginalised 
                or reclaimed through guilt and atonement. The symbolic identity 
                - the virtual reality - of the world of computer-mediated communication 
                is a rich and diverse culture comprised of highly specialised 
                skills, language and unifying symbolic meanings. 
              <p>As I have suggested, this community is essentially postmodern. 
                The IRC community shares a concern for diversity, for care in 
                nuances of language and symbolism, a realisation of the power 
                of language and the importance of social context cues, that are 
                hallmarks of postmodern culture. IRC culture fulfils Denzin's 
                prescription that the identity and activity of postmodern culture 
                should "make fun of the past [and of past cultural rituals] while 
                keeping it alive, and search for new ways to present the unpresentable 
                in order to break down the barriers that keep the profane out 
                of the everyday."<a

              It is tempting to view IRC in moral terms. I have sought to show 
              that IRC provides a medium in which behaviour that is both outside 
              of and in opposition to accepted social norms is accepted and even 
              encouraged. I have demonstrated the ways in which the IRC community 
              has developed its own distinctive system of significant signs and 
              symbols. But this is not to imply that the IRC community is democratic 
              or liberating. This freedom - from old conventions and to create 
              new ones - can be both positive and negative. 'Positive' forms of 
              human interaction exist on IRC - there is friendship, tolerance, 
              humour, even love. There is also hatred, violence, shame and guilt. 
              The 'freedom' of computer mediated communication is expressed in 
              a lack of conventional social controls, not in any utopian implication. 
              <p>I feel that it would be a mistake to project future societal 
                effects from the kinds of phenomena that I have described as happening 
                on IRC. But the temptation is there. On this issue, Johansen, 
                Vallee and Spangler say: 
              <p> 
              <blockquote>Whenever a new technology emerges, it is tempting to 
                predict that it will lead to a new and better form of society. 
                The technology for electronic meetings is no exception. The new 
                media invite a look at alternative organizations and alternative 
                societies. Combined with current social concerns, they also encourage 
                utopian visions... In this vision, electronic media create a sense 
                of community and commonalty among all people of the world...<a 
  href="http://www.crosswinds.net/~aluluei/electropolis.htm#note77">(77)</a> </blockquote>
              <p>Such a wide-ranging conclusion is unjustifiable. As I have shown, 
                IRC users can share a sense of community and commonalty, but they 
                can also exhibit alienation and hostility. It is impossible to 
                say which, if either, will prevail in IRC's future. 
              <p>Nevertheless, the cultural play that occurs on IRC does have 
                implications for individual players beyond the scope of the virtuality 
                of the computer network. If, as Hiltz and Turoff have said, users 
                of CMC systems can come to feel that their most highly emotional 
                relationships are with fellow users whom they rarely or never 
                see, then this indicates the potential for computer-mediated communication 
                systems to influence the lives of their users. Certainly for 'Lori' 
                and 'Daniel', and for 'Allison', the virtual reality of Internet 
                Relay Chat has strongly affected their relationships with others 
                and their view of themselves. For them, and others, 'virtuality' 
                is reality. 
              <p>IRC has the potential to affect users of the system in many and 
                often opposing ways. For the shy and socially ill-at-ease, computer 
                mediated communication can provide a way of learning social skills 
                in a non-threatening environment. It may also provide a crutch 
                and an excuse not to develop social skills that can be implemented 
                in the 'real world'. Relationships formed on IRC may be supportive, 
                deeply felt and may give users much happiness. They may also lead 
                to a reluctance to form relationships outside the electronic medium, 
                and may be in themselves painful due to the lack of possibilities 
                for the expression of more conventional forms of affection. The 
                cross- cultural, international nature of IRC can create a sense 
                of empathy and tolerance for differing cultures. It can also provide 
                a medium for the uninhibited expression of racial hatred. Little 
                is as yet known about the potential psychological and social effects 
                of computer-mediated communication. At present we have, as Hiltz 
                and Turoff admit, "only the skimpiest of insights" into what those 
                effects might be, and which might predominate.<a 
href="http://www.crosswinds.net/~aluluei/electropolis.htm#note78">(78)</a> 
              <p>It would be easy to gloss over the less attractive aspects of 
                IRC and to stress the more positive side. IRC is, after all - 
                as it was intended to be - fun. Nevertheless, those unattractive 
                aspects cannot be ignored. IRC, in common with other examples 
                of computer mediated communication, has no intrinsic moral implications. 
                It is a cultural tool, of a kind whose specific discursive background 
                I have located in postmodernism, that can be used in a number 
                of differing and contradictory ways. 
              <p>Moral judgement of IRC is fruitless, since the possibilities 
                are so balanced that it is unclear which aspects of IRC might 
                be dominant - if any are. IRC is essentially postmodern, and as 
                such its cultural subversion can be as effectively channelled 
                at egalitarianism as at racism, at feminism as at sexism. IRC 
                cannot be made to serve a moral point - but it can be used to 
                problematise the discourses of many academic disciplines. 
              <p>Interaction on IRC presents many anomalies that cannot be understood 
                in the light of present discourse. Its mode of communication is 
                synchronous, yet interlocutors are neither proximate nor necessarily 
                known to each other. There is a lack of conventional social and 
                emotive context cues - yet conversation can be highly personalised, 
                and a social structure has emerged. IRC is a social phenomena, 
                yet its existence is in the nowhere of electron states and its 
                artifacts in magnetic recordings. If IRC, and computer-mediated 
                communication in general, is to be fully understood and analysed, 
                then the conventions of many disciplines must be deconstructed. 
                Linguistics, communication theory, sociology, anthropology - and 
                history - are challenged by the culture shared by the users of 
                IRC. The divisions between spoken and written, and synchronous 
                and asynchronous forms of language, are broken down. The idea 
                that as the communication bandwidth narrows interaction should 
                become increasingly impersonal does not hold true for IRC. Understandings 
                of cultural significances as relying on physical display are challenged. 
                Factors of authority, hierarchy and social control are reconstructed. 
                IRC deconstructs and reconstructs not only its own structure but 
                also the conventions of the discourses that might address it. 
              <p>If these disciplines are to be able to address postindustrial, 
                postmodern phenomena, they must be able to incorporate the challenges 
                that those phenomena offer them. IRC is only one example of the 
                kinds of interaction that are increasingly common in media utilising 
                high-tech, computerised technology. As it becomes more common 
                - as more corporations take to electronic mail and news systems 
                to facilitate communication, as more academics from non-science 
                disciplines begin to utilise the facilities offered by the Internet, 
                as more people come to rely on the styles of communication, community 
                and culture that have developed on Internet Relay Chat - discourse, 
                and therefore disciplines, must alter to encompass these media.

              <h1><a name=App>Appendix: The IRC Program</a></h1>
              Both IRC server and client software has changed considerably since 
              this thesis was written in 1991. This Appendix describes the main 
              IRC commands available at the time the thesis was written. 
              <p>The IRC user interface consists of a status line on the second 
                line from the bottom of the user's screen, and a command line 
                on the bottom of the screen on which typed input from the user 
                can be seen. The remainder of the screen shows the activity of 
                other users, results of input to the command line, or the results 
                of information requests of the IRC program. From this interface 
                a number of commands can be issued. The syntax for a command is: 
              <pre>/&lt;command-name&gt; &lt;command-modifiers&gt;</pre>
              There are three sets of commands, available to three sets of users. 
              'User commands' are available to all users of IRC; 'chanop commands' 
              are available to the initiators of a channel; and 'oper commands' 
              are available to IRC server operators. 
              <p> 
              <h2>User Commands</h2>
              <dl> 
                <dt>Away: 
                <dd>/away &lt;some-string-of-text&gt; is used when a user does 
                  not wish to leave IRC, but can't attend to the screen for a 
                  while. Anyone who /msg's or /whois's that user will be sent 
                  a message saying that he is away, with his explanatory text 
                  string attached. Msg's sent to him will be there for him to 
                  read when he, say, gets back from lunch, and he will not have 
                  given the senders the impression that he is ignoring them. Msg's 
                  sent will be displayed to the recipient with the time and date 
                  received shown. 
                <dt>Bye: 
                <dd>/bye quits IRC. 
                <dt>Clear: 
                <dd>/clear clears the screen. 
                <dt>Help: 
                <dd>/help &lt;command-name&gt; will give the user detailed instructions 
                  on how to use a specific command. 
                <dt>Ignore: 
                <dd>/ignore &lt;nickname&gt; &lt;message-type&gt; makes the messages 
                  of a specified type, from a given user, invisible to the issuer. 
                  The use of 'all' for 'message-type' makes the specified user 
                  invisible. 
                <dt>Join: 
                <dd>/join &lt;channel-name&gt; joins a channel of that name, or 
                  creates one if a channel of that name does not exist. There 
                  are four types of channel: 
                  <dl> 
                    <dt>Null channel: 
                    <dd>when the user initially enters IRC he will be placed in 
                      channel 0, which is the null channel - he cannot see the 
                      activity of any other users on that channel, but he can 
                      issue commands, and receive and send private messages. This 
                      null channel is a necessity considering that there are usually 
                      over two hundred people using IRC at any one time. 
                    <dt>Numeric channels: 
                    <dd>these channels can be of three types - public channels 
                      (that show up on a /list or /names), secret channels (which 
                      don't show up on /list etc., but the users on them are listed 
                      as being on the null channel) and hidden channels (neither 
                      channel name nor users on it will be shown by any user command). 
                      Public channels are numbers 1-999, secret channels are numbers 
                      1000 and up, and hidden channels are negative numbers. 
                    <dt>+channels: 
                    <dd>these channels have a text name, prefixed by a '+' (ie. 
                      +mychannel, +hottub and +gblf). The status of the channel 
                      can be selected by the channel operator (see /mode command). 
                    <dt>#channels: 
                    <dd>these channels have a text name, prefixed by a '#' (ie. 
                      #twilight_ or #report). As with +channels, the channel status 
                      can be set by the channel operator. Unlike '+' channels 
                      and numeric channels, a user may be on more than one, and 
                      up to ten, #channels at one time, in addition to being on 
                      one +channel or numeric channel. </dd>
                  </dl>
                  Note that /join will, if issued from a +channel or a numeric 
                  channel, automatically exit the user from that channel before 
                  he can join another + or numeric channel. 
                <dt>Leave: 
                <dd>/leave &lt;channel-name&gt; leaves that channel. If the user 
                  is not on any other channels, he is placed in the null channel. 
                <dt>Links: 
                <dd>/links lists the currently active set of IRC servers. 
                <dt>List: 
                <dd>/list will give the user a list of all active chat channels, 
                  the number of users on each, and the topics associated with 
                  each channel. 
                <dt>Lusers: 
                <dd>/lusers will tell the user how many people are on IRC, how 
                  many "have a connection to the twilight zone" (are IRC operators) 
                  and how many channels there are. 
                <dt>Msg: 
                <dd>/msg &lt;nickname or channel-name&gt; sends a private message 
                  to another user, or to all users on a specific channel. 
                <dt>Names: 
                <dd>/names will list all channels and the nicks of people attached 
                  to them. Chanops will be marked by an '@' sign prefixing their 
                  nick. 
                <dt>Nick: 
                <dd>/nick &lt;some-string-of-text&gt; changes the user's IRC nickname. 
                  Note that IRC nicks can only be up to nine characters long. 
                <dt>Query: 
                <dd>/query &lt;nickname&gt; opens a private conversation with 
                  another user. Until a second query command, without an argument, 
                  is issued, everything that the user types will be by default 
                  sent only to the specified user instead of to a channel. 
                <dt>Time: 
                <dd>/time &lt;servername&gt; will display the time and date local 
                  to that IRC server. If a servername is not specified then the 
                  time and date local to the user's server will be shown. 
                <dt>Topic: 
                <dd>/topic &lt;some-string-of-text&gt; will set or change the 
                  topic of the channel the user is on to the string specified. 
                <dt>Wallops: 
                <dd>/wallops &lt;some-string-of-text&gt; writes a message to all 
                  IRC operators online. This is useful if, for instance, special 
                  help is needed with IRC. 
                <dt>Who: 
                <dd>/who will return a list of the users currently on IRC, giving 
                  their IRC nicknames and host addresses. This command can be 
                  modified to list only users on particular servers, or particular 
                  hosts. For instance. '/who -server *.au' would return a list 
                  of all the people on Australian servers; '/who *' returns a 
                  list of the users is on the same channel as the issuer of the 
                  command; '/who &lt;channel-name&gt;' lists users on a particular 
                  channel. 
                <dt>Whois: 
                <dd>/whois &lt;nickname&gt; gives detailed information about a 
                  user on IRC. 
                <dt>Whowas: 
                <dd>/whowas &lt;nickname&gt; gives detailed information about 
                  a user who has recently logged off the system or recently changed 
                  nicknames. </dd>
              </dl>
              <p> 
              <h2>Chanop Commands</h2>
              <dl> 
                <dt>Invite: 
                <dd>/invite &lt;nickname&gt; invites a user to the channel that 
                  the issuer of the command is on. Note that this command can 
                  be used by non-chanops if the channel is not invite-only. 
                <dt>Kick: 
                <dd>/kick &lt;channel-name&gt; &lt;nickname&gt; throws a specified 
                  user off that channel and places them in the null channel. 
                <dt>Mode: 
                <dd>this command is used by channel operators, who are the people 
                  who initially invoked a channel name or have had chanop status 
                  given them by a chanop. The syntax is: /mode &lt;channel-name&gt; 
                  &lt;modifier&gt; &lt;parameter&gt;. Modifiers are: 
                  <dl> 
                    <dt>p 
                    <dd>Private channel. Users who are not on the channel will 
                      not see the channel name on a /names or /who list - the 
                      members of the channel will appear to be on the null channel. 
                    <dt>s 
                    <dd>Secret channel. Users who are not on the channel will 
                      not see the channel name on a /names or /who list, nor will 
                      the names of the people who are on the channel appear on 
                      any listing. The channel and users on it are invisible. 
                    <dt>m 
                    <dd>Moderated channel. Only chanops can 'speak'.

                <dd>/kill &lt;nickname&gt; breaks the specified user's connection 
                  to the IRC network.

                <dd>/oper &lt;nickname&gt; &lt;password&gt; users who have the 
                  potential for operator privileges initially invoke those privileges 
                  with this command, where nickname is the nickname under which 
                  operation is intended, and password is the password known to 
                  the chat system for that nickname.

              <p>There are a number of other commands available to IRC operators 
                - /trace, /connect, /squit, /stats for example - pertaining to 
                the technical operation of IRC, controlling the network connections 
                and so forth. These commands are numerous and not strictly relevant 
                to my essay so I have chosen to exclude them from this list.

                  CMC on human interaction per se, they discuss computer-mediated 
                  communities in the context of 'hacking', that is, unauthorised

                <li><a name=note6></a>A common test has been the assessment of 
                  the time taken and methods used by CMC groups to reach concensus 
                  on a given problem as compared to face-to-face groups. See, 
                  for instance, KIESLER, SARA, JANE SIEGEL, and TIMOTHY W. McGUIRE.

                  of the kind of communication that occurs on IRC, which is chat 
                  rather than debate.

                  of have only been available to me in electronic format, although 
                  they have been published in the United States. These are: MEYER, 
                  GORDON and JIM THOMAS, "The Baudy World of the Byte Bandit" 
                  (see Note 7), and BARLOW, JOHN PERRY. "Crime and Puzzlement: 
                  Desperados of the DataSphere" electronic manuscript (also published 
                  in <em>Whole Earth Review</em>, Sausalito, California, Fall 
                  1990, pp.45-57). The former was electronically mailed to me 
                  by the authors, the latter was posted to the newsgroup 'alt.hackers'. 
                  In referring to these articles, I have cited the electronic 
                  form of the texts, since that is what I have been working with, 
                  giving line numbers rather than page references. However, electronic 
                  manuscripts would generally be read from within a text editor 
                  or word processor, enabling the reader to search for a specific 
                  text string.

                <li><a name=note19></a>Based on a conversation with 'Max' on IRC, 
                  Thursday July 11th, 22:20. My quotes from IRC sessions are taken 
                  from 'logs', computer files which consist of the records of 
                  conversations on IRC, either kept by me or given to me by the 
                  log keepers. In all quotes from logged IRC sessions, I have 
                  preserved the original spelling and syntax. I have, however, 
                  changed the names of the interlocutors unless I have been specifically 
                  requested by them not to do so. I have done my best to be certain 
                  that I have not used nicknames already in use on IRC - if I 
                  have inadvertently done so, my apologies to the people concerned. 
                  I have also deleted the Internet emailing addresses of IRC users 
                  so as to protect their privacy - for instance, my own address 
                  emr@munagin.ee.mu.oz.au appears as *@*.*.*.oz.au. I have thus 
                  indicated the geographic location of users without disclosing 
                  their full addresses and identities. In the version submitted 
                  to the University of Melbourne, these logs were included as

                  by users and constructors of computer systems designed to mimic 
                  'real life'. The word 'virtual' is also used to describe individual 
                  computer- simulated equivalents of aspects of reality. The ABC 
                  recently aired a program discussing the technology of virtual 
                  reality: the BBC production "Colonising Cyberspace: Advances 
                  in Virtual Reality Technology" was shown on Sunday 11th August 
                  at 9:30pm as part of the "Horizens" series.

                  Sproull and Kiesler's comment suggests that user names were 
                  predetermined in the system that they were investigating. If 
                  this has been generally the case in the CMC systems that have 
                  been written about, then users may not have the option of altering 
                  names, and therefore potentially their perceived gender.

                  that it is in almost - that is, barring technical mishaps - 
                  permanent use. The acronym stands for 'gays, bisexuals, lesbians 
                  and friends.' Other 'permanent' IRC channels are +hottub, known 
                  for flirtatious chat, and +initgame, in which users play games 
                  of 'twenty questions'.

                <li><a name=note62></a>This term is in general use throughout 
                  the computer network. The "The on-line hacker Jargon File, version 
                  2.9.4, July 1991" defines them as follows: <br>
                  emoticon: /ee-moh'ti-kon/ n. An ASCII glyph used to indicate 
                  an emotional state in email or news. Hundreds have been proposed, 
                  but only a few are in common use. These include:<br>
                  :-) 'smiley face' (for humor, laughter, friendliness, occasionally 
                  sarcasm)<br>
                  :-( 'frowney face' (for sadness, anger, or upset)<br>
                  ,-) 'half-smiley' ({ha ha only serious}), also known as 'semi-smiley' 
                  or 'winkey face'.<br>
                  :-/ 'wry face'<br>
                  (These may become more comprehensible if you tilt your head 
                  sideways, to the left.). The first 2 listed are by far the most 
                  frequently encountered. Hyphenless forms of them are common 
                  on CompuServe, GEnie, and BIX, see also {bixie}. On {USENET}, 
                  `smiley' is often used as a generic term synonymous with {emoticon}, 
                  as well as specifically for the happy-face emoticon. It appears 
                  that the emoticon was invented by one Scott Fahlman on the CMU 
                  {bboard} systems around 1980. He later wrote: "I wish I had 
                  saved the original post, or at least recorded the date for posterity, 
                  but I had no idea that I was starting something that would soon 
                  pollute all the world's communication channels." Note that CompuServe, 
                  GEnie, and BIX are computer networks. 
                <li><a name=note63></a>Note that the setting of an 'away message' 
                  causes all private messages sent to someone who is /away to 
                  appear on their screen with the date and time at which they 
                  were received shown. The sender receives the 'away message' 
                  - this function is mostly used when a person must be away from 
                  their terminal for a while, but does not wish to leave IRC.

                  known as Usenet News, contains many hundreds of groups, which 
                  are organised into divisions according to their application. 
                  Each division will contain many newsgroups, further divided 
                  into smaller subdivisions. These divisions and their subdivisions 
                  are known as hierarchies. Examples of major newsgroup divisions 
                  are the 'alt', 'rec' and 'sci' hierarchies, which contain such 
                  newsgroups as alt.irc, rec.humour, rec.society.greek, rec.society.italian

                  has been banished from the IRC system by an operator named 'MaryD', 
                  the second that a user named 'mic' was 'killed' by an operator 
                  named 'mgp.' 'Dumping' denotes the sending of long strings of 
                  text to the IRC environment. This is frowned upon since it prevents 
                  other users from being able to converse, and because it can 
                  cause the IRC server connections to malfunction. 'ctrl-gs' refers 
                  to the combination of the [control] and [g] keys on a computer 
                  keyboard which, when pressed together, will cause the computer 
                  to sound a 'beep'. If many 'ctrl-gs' are sent to an IRC channel 
                  then the terminals of all the channel participants will 'beep', 
                  which can be extremely annoying to those users. '/kill notices' 
                  are accompanied by technical information regarding the details 
                  of the 'path' over the computer network that the command travelled 
                  - these details, being lengthy and irrelevant to my purpose, 
                  I have omitted. Note that there is nothing to stop 'killed' 
                  users from reconnecting to IRC.

                  Again, I have deleted all information pertaining to the IRC 
                  network routes from these messages.

                  Note that Chas's 'laughter', and Alfred's final comment, are 
                  wallop messages, that is, a message written to all operators.

                  Information Overload." <em>Communications of the ACM</em> Volume

                <li><a name=note73></a>Apparently, Kuwait had just purchased an 
                  Internet link some few weeks before the Iraq invasion, and, 
                  while radio and television broadcasts out of the country were 
                  quickly stifled, almost a week passed before the Internet link 
                  was disabled. A number of Kuwaiti students were able to use 
                  IRC during this time and gave on-the-spot reports. Israel is 
                  also on the Internet, and I am told that users from the two 
                  countries often interacted with very few disagreements and mostly 
                  with sympathy for each other's position and outlook. A similar 
                  pattern was followed during the attempted Russian coup. At times 
                  of such international crisis, IRC users will form a channel 
                  named +report in which news or eyewitness reports from around 
                  the world will be shared.
