# Using Pastebins to share text
Frequently, IRC users need to share snippets of text with other users. It is
generally accepted IRC etiquette that users should not paste large amounts of
text into a channel or query window.

The definition of large varies, but generally speaking, 3-4 lines is the
upper bound of what is acceptable to paste directly into IRC - any more is
at best viewed as extremely rude, and at worst regarded as an attack.

A number of third party sites has sprung up around the need to paste and share
text with other users. A few of these sites are listed below for the convenience
of our readers.

* <http://www.pastebin.com>
* <http://paste.debian.net>
* <https://gist.github.com>
* <http://pastie.org/>

*Inclusion on this list does not imply endorsement of these sites by IRCHelp.org
or the authors of this document.*

The above list is by no means complete - there are dozens of others out there.
All of these sites share a common feature - you can copy and paste text into the
website, click a submit button, and be redirected to a page containing your
pasted text, which you can then share with others on IRC or elsewhere.

Note that pastebin sites offer little guarantees of privacy or security - they
are designed to conveniently share public data.
