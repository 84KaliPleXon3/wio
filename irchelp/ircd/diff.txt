< <P>If you just can't meet those conditions, such as if you have a new/small channel, you are on your own. You must cycle the channel (clear everybody out and restart it) to regain ops. Consider it your first challenge: If you can't even manage the channel properly (by keeping ops or cycling the channel) when you have only a few people in it, imagine the chaos if you had 50 or 500 people in the future. The simple fact is, running an EFnet channel takes 5-10 people (not bots) with identd and 24/7 static connections who are organized and trust each other. If you don't have that, what's the point of having a channel anyway? Visitors aren't going to come to some small, poorly organized channel when there are hundreds of thousands of <a href="../chanlist/">bigger channels</a> already. If you must run a channel anyway, consider moving your new/small channel to a <A HREF="../networks/">network</A> with registration such as DALnet.

< <P>A takeover is defined as when there are still ops on the channel, but they never held ops before. It does not cover internal op disputes, where regular ops fight for control. In other words, if somebody was one of your top 10 most regular ops over the last 2 weeks (anything before that is totally irrelevant, doesn't matter who "founded" the channel or if they held ops for years), he can do anything he wants including deoping everybody else. On a network without registration, that's the unfortunate result of trusting the wrong people, but neither CHANFIX nor anybody else can help then.

< <P>Once we verify there is a takeover, CHANFIX can be triggered manually. It would first de-op everybody and remove all modes that might keep people out (including bans, invite-only, etc.). Then CHANFIX restore ops as it normally would in an opless channel, which would presumably re-op the "right" people since they held ops most regularly.

> <P>If you had an actual takeover by an outsider, then you need to figure out how they got ops (accidental op, "hacked" bot/shell, <A HREF="../nuke/">DoS</A>, etc.) and make sure it doesn't happen again. We do not issue fixes until you have demonstrated that you won't get taken over again right away. You also need to have 2 or more of your <a href="#qualify">qualifying</a> former ops online and awake, either sitting in the channel or ready to rejoin at a moment's notice. Be ready to act to secure the channel right after the fix is issued.

< <P><B>To reverse a takeover, if you meet all the same conditions for opless channels in <a href="#qualify">5A</a> above, go to EFnet #CHANFIX and tell us the name of your channel</B>. We will help you as soon as we can.

> <P>How does the fix actually work? Once we verify there is a takeover, CHANFIX can be triggered manually. It would first de-op everybody and remove all modes that might keep people out (including bans, invite-only, etc.). This is when you must rejoin quickly. Then CHANFIX restores ops to the regular ops as it would in an opless channel.
