# Overview

Not everyone has an IRC client installed on their computer, and for many people that only use IRC occasionally, or may be one-off visitors to IRC, it's useful to provide alternative access, usually in a form that can be accessed via a web browser.

## Webchat Gateways

Web gateways provide access with only a web browser, using a backend program on the server to proxy the IRC connection into HTTP and HTML (and sometimes JavaScript) to provide a user interface.

 * [qwebirc](http://qwebirc.org/)

 
## Java & Flash Clients

Java and Flash both have the potential to connect directly to an IRC server without the web server acting as a middleman. They can be embedded into a webpage, but, unlike gateways, once downloaded, they don't consume server resources, and they all make seperate connections to IRC servers.


## Hosted Clients

### Mibbit

Mibbit is a large, public web gateway designed to be easily embedded as a widget on other pages, as well as used directly. Mibbit is able to connect to most networks, and when used directly, supports multiple network connections and most features of a desktop client, but because it proxies connections to the IRC servers through it's own service, it's been banned from some servers and networks at various times.

### Other Public Web Gateways

Various public web gateways may be usable for your purposes as well, but are generally associated with or restricted to specific networks.
