<b>What is a bot?</b><br>
<br>
  Short for <font color="#ff0000"><b>Robot</b></font>, it is an <font color="#ff0000"><b>I</b></font>nternet
<font color="#ff0000"><b>R</b></font>elay <font color="#ff0000"><b>C</b></font>hat
(IRC) client that is scripted to react to exterior commands   and events without
direct input from a user at a keyboard.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<b>What are bots used for?</b><br> Most bots are benign and used to
keep a particular channel open. Often they are used for channel
maintenance, such as kicking users for
rude language,
to stop flooding in a channel, or remove offensive nicks.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Other bots have a specific purpose, such as helping to run a game or serving
virtual drinks. A few can be abusive     bots such as war or takeover bots.  Almost all IRC Nets and servers do not allow
<b>    war</b> or <b> takeover</b> bots.&nbsp;Attempting to run such bots is a
quick way to get k-lined from a network.</font>
</p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">Some Networks such as <b>Undernet</b>
provides services to registered channels via
bots "X" and "W". DALnet provides services without using bots per se.
EFnet does not provide services for its channels, leaving that up to
each individual channel to provide.&nbsp;(Okay,
they just started a very limited "re-op" service).<br>
<br>
<b>Bot Operating Systems&nbsp;</b><br> Bots are usually one of two
kinds: 1. Unix or linux based bots that operate from a shell account.
2. Windows based bots that operate from a windows based machine. The
most common on IRC is the
Eggshell bot (also called an "eggie" or "eggbot").&nbsp; However, with
more 24/7 accounts available via cable modem or DSL accounts, running a
Windows based bot is becoming easier.<br>
<br>
<b>Which is better, Eggbots or Windows bots?</b><br> The one that does
what you need for the least amount of expense and effort is usually the
"best" bot.
Eggbot's are generally acknowledged as being much more stable (up and
connected) than windows bots. However, a good windows based machine
without a lot of other processing on it can keep a bot up and connected
for weeks at a time.&nbsp;
And it's a handy way to use that old computer that is gathering dust in
the
corner.&nbsp; Eggies are probably harder to get up and started for a
new user,
but take less attention overall.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>

<br>
<b>How do I get an EggBot?&nbsp;</b><br> You need a shell account.
These usually cost money, running from 10 or 15 dollars a month for a
shell account. Then you need to install a script, compile it and keep
it updated.&nbsp;
Most free shell providers do not allow IRC eggbots!&nbsp; You will have
to pay
for a shell account on a server, then upload, compile, and configure
your bot
script.<br>

<br>
<b>How do I get a windows based bot?</b><br>
  If you have a 24/7 <font size="1"><font color="#000000">(24 hours a day / 7
days a week)</font> </font>account, normally a cable or <font color="#ff0000"><b>D</b></font>igital
<font color="#ff0000"><b>S</b></font>ubscriber <font color="#ff0000"><b>L</b></font>ine
(DSL) account, you can usually purchase a   second unique <font color="#ff0000"><b>I</b></font>nternet
<font color="#ff0000"><b>P</b></font>rotocol number (IP) from the provider for a nominal cost.&nbsp;
It costs me five bucks a month with ATT's @home service, for instance (but then
there is the cost of electricity and so on).&nbsp;
</font>
</p>

<p><font face="Arial"> Setting up a bot from your standard computer
or an <font color="#ff0000"><b>I</b></font>nternet <font color="#ff0000"><b>C</b></font>onnection
<font color="#ff0000"><b>S</b></font>haring (ICS) computer using the same
address will basically   end up looking like a "clone". That can get you kicked or k-lined from a
server. Ideally, your bot   should be on a computer with it's own unique IP.
However, some servers allow two clients from the same address.&nbsp; Check the
server's <font color="#ff0000"><b>M</b></font>essage <font color="#ff0000"><b>O</b></font>f
<font color="#ff0000"><b>T</b></font>he <font color="#ff0000"><b>D</b></font>ay
(MOTD) to see if they do (simply type: <b>/motd </b>).&nbsp; Depending on which IRC client   software you like to use, you need
to download (or write)... a bot script for that   client.
If you are going to run a mIRC bot, I suggest checking out <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20030810150105/http://www.xcalibre.com/">http://www.xcalibre.com&nbsp;</a>
or <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20030810150105/http://www.mircscripts.org/" target="_blank">http://www.mircscripts.org&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;for
bot scripts.<br>
<br>
<b>I have a <font color="#ff0000">L</font>ocal <font color="#ff0000">A</font>rea
<font color="#ff0000">N</font>etwork (LAN) at home running through a gateway
computer.&nbsp; Can I use one of these machines to be a bot while I chat on another one?&nbsp;</b><br>
 Technically yes, but you still end up looking like a "clone" because both machines    will
have the same IP.&nbsp; Some servers will allow you to run a second
"instance" of your client as a bot, others will not.&nbsp; If the bot
is a game bot or amusement bot, you probably have a better chance of running it
as a second instance.&nbsp; But for a long term bot connection, the machine
hosting your bot should
have a unique IP, ideally.<br>
