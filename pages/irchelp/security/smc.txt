1) First, configure the following mIRC options:

file | options | connect | options
   Default server port : 6667
      (if necessary, change 6667 to whatever the network requires like 7000)
   click on advanced button
   check the 2nd checkbox "Binds socket to ip", in the text box
      write your external ip adress
      (Don't know it? Try //USERHOST $me or //DNS $me, then check status window.)

file | options | connect | localinfo
   delete all text in Local Host and IP Address
   check "always get local host"
   select the radio button for lookup method "server"

file | options | dcc | options
   DCC port: first 1024, last 1028
      (that opens 5 ports which is enough for most people)

That's all for the mIRC configuration.

2) In the router:

Now you actually need to open and forward ports in your router's firewall.
This lets the router correctly send incoming traffic from the outside to your
PC.

In the Virtual Server page (setup | advanced settings | virtual server),
open the following ports, note that the private and public ports are the same.

Port 59 is the DCC server, 113 is for identd, 6667 (or whatever you set the
default server port to in mIRC earlier) is for IRC itself. And finally the
range of ports 1024 and up are for DCC sending, you can add more if you like,
just make sure you match it with what you put in mIRC's DCC options.

private port   type   public port
    59          tcp      59
   113          tcp     113
  6667          tcp    6667
  1024          tcp    1024
  1025          tcp    1025
  1026          tcp    1026
  1027          tcp    1027
  1028          tcp    1028

For each line, put in the private IP of your PC where you want to use IRC.
If you don't know your private IP, /run winipcfg. You may need to select
your network adapter from the popup text box on top.

3) You're done. Disconnect from the server and reconnect. If you did it right
you can check to see if identd is working by doing "/whois nickname" on
yourself, see if the ~ (tilde) before your username is gone. Then try to 
DCC send some small text file to a buddy.
