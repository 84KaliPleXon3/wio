Robin - Channel Protection Script for ircII

version 1.0, Dec 30, 1997

Initial Warnings:
	This script assumes that you untarred it from the parent directory of
	 your account and allowed it to create the subdirectories ~/scripts
	 and ~/scripts/ops. If you have made any changes to the default 
	 location of this package then you will need to make the necessary
	 changes in the various modules that need it. Primarily,
	 robin.load.mod
	 
        Don't be confused by all the files, robin.load.mod is the only
         file that you will need to load.
         Feel free, however, to peek inside the 
         various modules (I placed code comments in most of them).
        If you encounter recursion errors then you will need to 
         re-compile your client. This is not a bug within the script, 
         I wasted alot of time trying to track this down only to 
         discover that it was the client that was at fault.
        If you are one of the few that started beta-testing early
         then you will be pleased to know that ban and hban have now
         been re-enabled. The code, however, is uglier than i would like
         but it will suffice until i have more time to clean it up.
        Due to a lack of imagination at the time, the script is 
         tentatively titled Robin and /robin will get you to the 
         main help alias. I am open to suggestions on a final name
         for both the script and the main help alias. :)
        Lame references to myself in each module will probably be
         taken out before beta-testing ends.

This script is being developed for the sole purpose of providing
 new users some sort of working channel and flood protection without having
 to resort to all the hacked and bloated scripts, that are widely 
 distributed, which they think that they must have in order to irc.
 It is not my intention to write a full package script like purepak or
 penix. I am trying to keep the script as bare as possible while providing
 both functionality and a few standard amenities without having to delve
 into bot-like features (at least not very many).
I have also attempted to make each routine as simple and clear as possible
 and placed code comments where available in an attempt to educate the 
 user into understanding ircII scripting so that he or she may see the 
 wisdom in writing his or her own script. Later versions will contain 
 even more comments than this current version contains.

1: What this script has:
        a: Maintains a list of approved users and monitors server mode 
            changes in order to verify valid ops and de-op split-riders.
        b: ircII 2.8.2 has deficient ctcp flood protection so i have 
            incorporated GArfr's fix for this and made minor changes to
            enable the user to suppress the local echoes. Thanks to Garfr
            for allowing me to use his ctcpfix script. :)
        c: The ban and kick module automatically checks for either a domain
            or ip address and bans appropriately. You have the option of
            performing normal bans or host bans. This module also allows
            you to automatically remove any bans that could affect a certain 
            user by doing /unban nick. The help files will give you more 
            detail on this.

2: What the script is not:
        a: This script is not supposed to be some white hat version of an
             eggdrop. With this in mind, I have been very paranoid about 
             the features that I will and will not put in it. This does not
             mean that I am not open to suggestions for improvements or 
             additions. In fact, it is quite the opposite. So far I have 
             written this script alone and with little input (but alot of
             guidance and influence) from others and as a result what has
             been written into and what has been taken out of the script
             has been subject to my opinion only. I welcome any input
             any of you have (whether beta-tester or just a curious person
             wanting to see what I have done).
        b: I am currently planning on leaving "ops on msg" out of the
            actual distribution because it is quite bot-like and really
            does encourage idling (I know, I am a hypocrite... but what if
            all thirty thousand users were idling as I do? :) ). If 
            enough of my peers (you) feel that it should remain in the
            script then I will reconsider it (secretly i would like to
            but I just feel that it is not appropriate in terms of the
            premise behind why this scripted came into being in the first
            place.)
        c: I will never write fserves, splatter kicks and the like for 
            this package.
        d: I am certain that I have left something out. 

3: Near future plans:
        a: I am pondering the idea of writing a shell script that will
            automatically unpack the archive and insert itself into the
            users' .ircrc file. ( I know that this is lame, but how often
            have you listened to "... how do i load scripts?")
        b: Cleaning the code for the bans.and.kicks.mod
        c: I am also considering writing an automatic logger for flood
            attacks.
        d: oh yeah, and a big credits file to everyone who has helped
            and influenced me on this. If it were not for #irchelp my 
            interest in irc probably would have died a long time ago.

This script is being distributed amongst volunteers from #irchelp on both
 the efnet and the ircnet networks. This should give a varied enough testing
 ground (ircd2.8x+, ircd2.9x+, ircII2.8.2, ircII2.9(roof and alpha's), and 
 hopefully a few other ircII versions and derivatives.) for ensuring 
 compatibility and reliability.
Thank you very much for helping me test this script, I trust that you will
 make every effort to break it for me and email any responses, opinions,
 suggestions and or errors to me at the following address.

This is a natural product. The slight variations in spellign and grammar
enhance its' individual character and beauty and in no way are to be
