This client is what I usually recommend new users try first, because it is the most rich in features and has been actively developed since the '90s, with dozens of updates over the past few years while the traditional gold standard Ircle has essentially stood still. Snak appeals to people who prefer a streamlined interface without sacrificing all the latest bells and whistles. Everything for each channel is contained in one window. The channel list feature is particularly fast and easy to use (unlike Ircle). Very easy to set up and configure. Supports both the scripting language from the classic <A HREF="/irchelp/ircii/">ircII</A> client for *nix (UNIX, Linux, etc.) shell access acounts, so you can tap into the wealth of existing ircII scripts, as well as Ircle-style Applescript scripts. Supports multiple connections, and for each connection, uses ircII-style server lists which will automatically try the next server in a list until it succeeds (Ircle only allows one server to be defined for each connection). Guardian feature permits adult control, for what that's worth (Ircle has none). Excellent built-in help menu, balloon help, and bundled help manual (Ircle has none). $25 shareware is a great value and an example of how <a href="../misc/shareware.html">shareware</a> really can work.

For years, Ircle was the gold standard against which all other Mac IRC clients were compared. Ircle is still one of the most popular, perhaps simply because it was the only option that was full-featured, stable, fairly easy to use, and stuck around for years. Ircle pioneered many ideas: scripting via AppleScript, simultaneous connections to multiple networks, file servers to exchange files, and channel protection features. Active development ended with version 3.0.4 in 1999, but there are periodic 3.1 beta releases mostly to maintain compatibility with OS X. Ircle's support is disappointing: minimal setup guides, barebones built-in help, and no user manual at all. Thankfully, because it's been around so long, there are many 3rd party support sites, free scripts, help channels, etc. $20 shareware.

<P>
<B>Setting up Ircle</B>: You can jump right in by selecting one of the pre-configured network/channel combinations from the included "Chat channels" folder. Alternatively, set things up properly using the <I>Connections</I> window. If you need help, check out our illustrated, step by step <A HREF="http://www.irchelp.org/irchelp/mac/ircle_setup.html">setup guide</A> or the Ircle home page's <A HREF="http://www.ircle.com/reference/">reference pages</A>.

It's a sign of the times, but now that Mac OS X has become mainstream, Apple is the world's #1 distributor of *nix (UNIX/Linux/BSD etc.) computers! If you are reasonably savvy with IRC, you should probably consider the text-only shell clients like ircII. This tends to be the choice of the most experienced IRC users.

<P>The icon says it all. These clients used to have loyal followings or offered unique features, but all have been abandoned by their authors. We describe them here mostly for historical reasons, but we do not recommend you use them due to their outdated features and lack of support.

<P><A HREF="http://www.macirc.com/">MacIRC</A> was a simple, stable client, but  has been abandoned since 1997. The last public version (0.9.6) is usable, but lacks many basic and important functions: /list and /server don't work, /msg and tab key both engage /query mode, IRC opers look like regular users, no bold/inverse/underline, etc.

<P><A HREF="http://www.shadowirc.com">ShadowIRC</A> was designed to be lean and mean client, trading away features and conveniences for speed and stability. ShadowIRC was designed for users experienced with "/irchelp/" commands since there are no buttons or palettes. (If that describes you, you might want to just try out *nix clients like <a href="../ircii/">ircII</a>. After all, Mac OS X is *nix anyway.) Development stopped in 2000 and instead it became freeware and open source, both unique among Mac IRC clients. Theoretically others can pitch in to add features and keep things up to date, but this has not happened.

<P><B>Other Reviews</B>:

We really try to focus our recommendations on clients that have withstood the test of time. If you just want a reliable program for chatting, there is really no reason to look beyond Ircle or Snak. If you like playing with new clients that might have interesting new features not to mention serious bugs, feel free to check out the many other choices described at these exhaustive sites.
