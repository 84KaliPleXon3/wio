# InspIRCd
[InspIRCd](http://www.inspircd.org/) is an IRCD writter in C++ for Unix-like and
Windows systems. It is one of the few to not be directly descended from the
original IRCD, and is actively developed and supported. It's released under a GPLv2
license, so it is both free software and open source.

## Features
* modular, virtually the entire ircd is based on loadable modules, including all protocol support
* SSL/TLS support
* IPv4 and IPv6 networking, including dual-stack.
* Protocol commands can be reloaded while in operation, allowing hotfixes with no downtime
* [IRCv3](http://ircv3.net/) extensions.
* Compatable with Anope and Atheme services.
* [Installer for Windows systems](https://wiki.inspircd.org/Windows_Installation)
