# This document has been removed.

We formerly had instructions for manually removing a number of common trojans
published on this site. These documents have been removed because they are badly
outdated and considered obsolete.

Manual removal of a virus or trojan is difficult, time consuming, and
requires positive identification of the exact infection, otherwise you may
either leave infected files behind, or damage important system files.

At the time, those instructions were necessary, because many of the threats
targeting IRC users were not handled appropriate by antimalware software of
the era.

These daus malware removal programs tend to more accurately detect and remove
infected files, even those with complex removal steps, making such instructions
largely unnecessary.

Please see [our section on trojan horses](/irchelp/security/trojan.html] for
current information.
