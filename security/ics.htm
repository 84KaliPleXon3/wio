<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Windows users, including Win98, Win ME, Win2000 pro can restore their DCC capability.&nbsp; It involves <b>Port
Mapping</b>.&nbsp; No, not <i> Port Scanning</i>!&nbsp; Port mapping allows the gateway
computer to pass info correctly between the client computers and the
internet.&nbsp; The simple fix is NAT32.&nbsp; It costs a few bucks, between
$25.00 and $50.00 US, depending on which version you purchase.&nbsp; All info

&lt;Jeepz-&gt; okay ..<br>
&lt;Wayne3&gt; Let me grab the URL for a good freeware port mapper. </font><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20030810152446/http://www.analogx.com/contents/download/network/pmapper.htm" target="_blank">

Freeware Port Mapper URL</font></a><font face="Courier New" size="2">
<br>
&lt;Wayne3&gt; If they install a port mapper, they will only be able to use
DCC with DCC Server on the specific port they set :)<br>
&lt;Jeepz-&gt; so they need to set a specific port in mIRC options?<br>
&lt;Jeepz-&gt; and the same port on their server?<br>
&lt;Wayne3&gt; Port in their DCC Server in mIRC options needs to be same as
the one being mapped on the gateway machine.<br>
&lt;Jeepz-&gt; any URL for doing the gateway setting .. I suppose that varies
depending on what software they use<br>
&lt;Wayne3&gt; Right ICS Wizard it auto, <b><i> I recommend they drop $30 and get
NAT32 <font color="#ff0000">*</font></i></b><br>
&lt;Wayne3&gt; NAT32 will allow DCC chat without any extra software&nbsp; </font><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20030810152446/http://www.nat32.com/" target="_blank"><font face="Arial" size="2">NAT32

</font></a>
<font face="Courier New" size="2">
&lt;Wayne3&gt;<b><i> NAT32 is better by 1000% <font color="#ff0000">*</font></i></b><br>
&lt;Jeepz-&gt; okay .. so they use nat32 to do their port mapping on the
gateway computer .. set the client computer (workstation) mIRC to use DCC server
and same port .. ?<br>
&lt;Wayne3&gt; Now if they are using a router it all work fine with DCC chat,
even across subnets and domains because the header information will contain the
correct address for the packets.

</font><p><font face="Courier New" size="2">&lt;Wayne3&gt; Okay firewall information.<br>
&lt;Jeepz-&gt; k ..&nbsp;<br>
&lt;Wayne3&gt; Most firewalls will block all unauthorized connections, but
for example ZoneAlarm allows you to add applications that are allowed to do
everything they want.<br>
&lt;Wayne3&gt; Users will want to look into that.<br>
&lt;Wayne3&gt; k, so always have them check that. If they can have them
disable the firewall and try to DCC to see if that is the issue.<br>
&lt;Wayne3&gt; np, another thing is to have the user always check with their
ISPs about Firewall, blocked ports, etc..<br>
&lt;Wayne3&gt; Some ISPs block port 80, 110, 23, 22, 25, etc.. to stop users
from running servers :)<br>
&lt;Wayne3&gt; Those are low level ports and only mail, web, ftp, and those
types of daemons would use bind to those ports :)<br>
&lt;Jeepz-&gt; right .. basic trouble shooting technique<br>
&lt;Wayne3&gt; Also ask them if they are using a HUB, a high collision rate
on the network can cause packets not reach their destination.<br>
&lt;Jeepz-&gt; okay ..<br>
&lt;Wayne3&gt; Causing slow DCC, or Unable to Connect Errors a few times,
then all of the sudden work<br>
&lt;Wayne3&gt; then fail again a couple times, then work, etc...<br>
&lt;Jeepz-&gt; erratic performance<br>
&lt;Jeepz-&gt; I see .. though many of these folks are on smaller home based
nets .. not all mind you<br>
&lt;Jeepz-&gt; but many .. that's getting much popular these days .. and a
source of many questions<br>
&lt;Jeepz-&gt; so that would possibly show up if they have a hub and maybe
five or six machines .. or does it need a much larger network to become a
problem?<br>
&lt;Wayne3&gt; If you get someone who cannot use mIRC at all with their
client machines make sure they can access LAN resources and browse the web
before trying to fix their mIRC problem!!<br>
&lt;Wayne3&gt; Sorry had to throw that in ;)<br>
&lt;Jeepz-&gt; oh yeah .. no prob ..<br>
&lt;Wayne3&gt; No I have experienced that problem before at friends house
with a 3 LAN network<br>
&lt;Jeepz-&gt; so small size isn't immune to it .. good to know</font></p>

&lt;Wayne3&gt; LinkSys 10BaseT 5 Port Hub (Home LAN) is very popular and is a
shit Hub and will collide every 5 seconds if more than one machine is access
something.<br>
&lt;Jeepz-&gt; ah .. yeah, I see folks using LinkSys often .. must be
inexpensive<br>
&lt;Wayne3&gt; Yep :)<br>
&lt;Jeepz-&gt; you have any suggestion for better performance while watching
pennies?<br>
&lt;Wayne3&gt; They build nice industry equipment, but their home base
products blow<br>
&lt;Wayne3&gt; I only recommend Cisco, Netgear, and 3Com networking hardware
:)<br>
&lt;Jeepz-&gt; k .. I use 3Com here .. so pay for what you get basically<br>
&lt;Wayne3&gt; Intel Pro is one NIC I make exception for because its a good
card :)<br>
&lt;Wayne3&gt; But it uses a 3com based chipset ;)<br>
&lt;Jeepz-&gt; ah ..<br>
&lt;Wayne3&gt; Yep, what you pay is what you get .. "If its to good to

&lt;Jeepz-&gt; Cisco's good stuff .. but pricey ..<br>

* Jeepz- nods</font><br>
&lt;Wayne3&gt; A Q&amp;D solution to a lot of collisions on a LAN is to get
another NIC on the Gateway machine :)<br>
&lt;Jeepz-&gt; two NIC on the gateway .. one to the net .. the other to the
LAN?<br>
&lt;Wayne3&gt; Right, one to their ISPs equipment and one to their HUB or
home Router.<br>

&lt;Wayne3&gt; I cannot count how many times I have typed the same IP into
two clients.<br>
&lt;Jeepz-&gt; does their ISP provide them with multiple IP's or is there a generally used
for protocol assignment?<br>
&lt;Wayne3&gt; I mean private IPs, like 192, 168, 172(or is it 176), 10.<br>
&lt;Wayne3&gt; On a LAN in the same subnet, ICS won't bitch at you for that,
and your basic features like email, web, and irc will work but DCC will not<br>
&lt;Jeepz-&gt; I see .. so it is a specific group that would be recognized
within the network but not viable for NET connection .. dunno if I'm phrasing
that so it makes sense<br>
&lt;Wayne3&gt; Yes, they are IPs reserved for LANs<br>

&lt;Wayne3&gt; Leave them blank and user server as the method, it should populate with
