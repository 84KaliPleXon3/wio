# IRC File Trading: "Geek-centric way to get free stuff"?

by Jolo@EFnet with help from many others, updated May 25, 2005

IRC stands for Internet Relay Chat; it was designed to allow people to _chat_
with each other in real time. Think of it as the granddaddy of IM and those
AOL or web "chat rooms." mIRC for Windows is the most popular IRC program.

IRC also has some very simple file sending abilities, intended originally for
people to send each other a picture or small text file, etc. Recently,
experienced IRC users have turned that into an illegal way to trade songs,
movies, games, etc., but note that word: _experienced_. Unlike other peer-to-
peer (P2P) file sharing protocols, IRC was never intended for widespread file
trading, so it has _no_ official, centralized list of files and _no_ standard
commands for trading files. That's why some call IRC the "geek-centric way to
get free stuff," which is a polite way of saying file trading is not suitable
for new users.

So how do all those 100000s of geeks do it anyway? If you seriously want to
know, [read on....](war2.html)

Whatever you do, please _don't_ go around randomly asking strangers for files
or typing "!list" or "@find". Also, keep in mind that people on IRC help
channels are volunteers who are there to answer legitimate IRC questions, not
to become your accomplice in crime. If you ignore this advice, you'll find
only ridicule or trouble.
